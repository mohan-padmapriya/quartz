Antifragility: The concept is extremely alien to us
> What ways to make it more obvious to us?

- As socities become more complex and technology more specialised and sophisticated, vulnerabilities increase

### In action: Just as I was thinking of the last point, my mind instinctively drew a dismal and hardship prone picture of the future. Proves how alien the concept really is.
> The result of vulnerability need not be struggle and somehow staying afloat. Could get better due to vulnerability. 

## What other things, like antifragility, are we missing out on simply because we dont have a name for it?

- Hormesis: Poison strengthens

- Stressors are important. Therefore fasting, therefore other deprivation from time to time. That's when you get opportunities to tuen chaos into order.
- A comfortable life, excess food --> complacency


### *Domain independence is domain dependent*
- Lack of translation from one domain to the other
- See truth that holds good in both domains

Example: PTSD and Post-traumatic growth


# 1. Necessity is the mother of all creation
> *How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal, trouble. I hold—it is beyond speculation, rather a conviction—that innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity (from the unintended side effects of, say, an initial invention or attempt at invention). Naturally, there are classical thoughts on the subject, with a Latin saying that sophistication is born out of hunger (artificia docuit fames). The idea pervades classical literature: in Ovid, difficulty is what wakes up the genius (ingenium mala saepe movent), which translates in Brooklyn English into “When life gives you a lemon …” 
> Yet in spite of the visibility of the counterevidence, and the wisdom you can pick up free of charge from the ancients (or grandmothers), moderns try today to create inventions from situations of comfort, safety, and predictability instead of accepting the notion that “necessity really is the mother of invention.”*
# 2. Comfort is truly your greatest enemy
- Look in aeronautics, where pilots are getting too comfortable with the automated systems, making them less alert, less challenged 

> *Many, like the great Roman statesman Cato the Censor, looked at comfort, almost any form of comfort, as a road to waste. He did not like it when we had it too easy, as he worried about the weakening of the will.*

Important:
> Undercompensation from the absence of a stressor, inverse hormesis, absence of challenge, degrades the best of the best.

## That's why we play really well against Mounts, but play like fart against BCBC. 
- That's why less audible people (that cause our brains to pay more attention) make stuff work and charm, unlike pitch perfect television presenters. 
- That's why you get more shit done when you have less time. 
- Therefore white noise
- Therefore distance makes the heart grow fonder
- Therefore the charm of unavailable people
- Therefore secrets travel; simply becuase they are secrets

--> There has to be a stressor

### Redundancy
Think a bit more about this.
Perhaps read again.



> So here is a simple rule of thumb (a heuristic): to estimate the quality of research, take the caliber of the highest detractor, or the caliber of the lowest detractor whom the author answers in print—whichever is lower.






- Equilibrium: bad idea

> The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s whatmakes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the  fragility ofindividual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.

- Evolution and antogragility
- Hinduism and antifragility

> For an illustration of how families of organisms like harm in order toevolve (again, up to a point), though not the organisms themselves, considerthe  phenomenon of  antibiotic resistance. The  harder you  try  to  harmbacteria, the  stronger the  survivors will  be—unless you  can  manage toeradicate them completely.  The  same with cancer therapy: quite oftencancer cells that  manage to  survive the  toxicity of  chemotherapy andradiation reproduce faster and take over the void made by the weaker cells.
> The cell has a population of intercellular molecules;in  turn  the  organism has  a  population of  cells, and  the  species has  apopulation of organisms. A strengthening mechanism for the species comesat the expense of some organisms; in turn the organism strengthens at theexpense of some cells, all the way down and all the way up as well.

> he economy has an equivalentlayering: individuals, artisans, small firms, departments within corporations,corporations, industries, the  regional economy,  and,  finally,  on  top,  thegeneral economy—one can even have thinner slicing with a larger numberof layers.For the economy to be antifragile and undergo what is called evolution,every single  individual business  must necessarily  be  fragile, exposed tobreaking—evolution needs organisms (or  their genes) to  die  whensupplanted by  others, in  order to  achieve improvement, or  to  avoidreproduction when they  are  not  as  fit  as  someone else
> People have difficulty realizing that the solution is building a systemin which nobody’s fall can drag others down—for continuous failures workto preserve the system. Paradoxically, many government interventions andsocial policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established


>We can mistake the antifragility of the systemfor that of the individual, when in fact it takes place at the expense of theindividual (the difference between hormesis and selection).

What does not kill me makes me stronger = I just passed an exit exam; there are several others that failed. Not antifrgility. 

Example: IIT-JEE eliminates the unfit candidates. If JEE didn't kill you, it didn't do anything to you. You didn't get any better by surviving it. But the system sure did. 

Q. How antifragile is your job?

- Switzerland is the most antifragile country because it benefits from shocks around the world. Which is the most fragile? Where do US, India stand?
- [[Procrustes]], his inn, and cutting/stretching guests to his standardised beds. Similarly, we deny our economies stressors
- How antifragile is your job really? A corporate job is relatively *stable*, smooth, and fragile, but not antifragile, due to the lack of variability, volatility, and vulnerability.

Small is antifragile, and real. Large breaks, is abstract. Large is simply statistics, and that's how beurocracy comes about
