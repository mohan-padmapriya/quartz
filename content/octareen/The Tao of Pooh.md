[[The Vinegar Tasters,]] an ancient Chinese painting. 
- Kung Fu'tse is sour; present out of step with the past, 
- Buddha is bitter, attachments cause pain, 
- Laozi is sweet, life is fundamentally good in its natural state, harmony of nature.  
  
P'u: simplicity  
Root meaning: tree or wood  
Phonetic: thicket  
Hence, "tree in a thicket" or "wood not cut" means "things in their natural state" which is the Uncarved Block.  
  
On Kung Fu'tse scholars, the Daos, said "The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise"  
Chuang-tse: "A well frog cannot imagine the ocean, not can a summer insect conceive of ice. How then can a scholar understand the [[Taoism | Dao]]? He is restricted by his own learning"  
  
Hard to find the spirit of [[Taoism]] in the lifeless writings of the humourless Academic Mortician. The Confusionist, Desiccated Scholar. Knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Pompous and pretentious papers no one can understand.  
  
Knowledge and experience don't speak the same language.  
  
# The Principle of Cottleston Pie  
1. A fly can't bird but a bird can fly; Things are as they are. People where they belong.  
2. A fish can't whistle and neither can I; knowing the limitations of one's own mind. A weakness if some sort can be a big favour, if you acknowledge the it is there.  
3. Why does a Chicken, I don't know why; it's okay you not know. Don't have to play abstract philosopher.  
  
Brain can be fooled, but not inner nature. Because people do not listen to Inner Nature, they don't understand themselves very well, and hence have a little respect for themselves. And they are easily influenced by others.  
  
The bad can only be raw material for the good. Change a minus into a plus.  
  
[[Wu-wei:]]  
Wu: without; wei: do  
Therefore, without action, or effort, or control.  
Paradox Wei wu Wei: action without action.  
  
It means without meddlesome, combative, or egotistical effort. The analogy to water. The character of Wei a clawing hand and a monkey. No monkeying around.  
  
"Tao does not do, but nothing is not done" Tao Te Ching.  
  
From Wei Wu Wei comes Tzu Jan: Self so; things happen by themselves, spontaneously.  
One must not try too hard, with a Tense mind.  
  
Chuang-tse : Wu Wei "flows like water, reflects like a mirror, responds like an echo"  
Like the Taoist martial art, T'ai Chi Ch'uan: not fire with fire, but fire with water. Don't add to the conflict, but neutralise the power by yielding.  
  
# The bisy backsons.  
Now, one thing that seems rather odd to us is  
that the Bisy Backson Society, which practically  
worships youthful energy, appearance, and attitudes,  
has developed no effective methods of retaining  
them, a lack testified to by an ever-increasing  
reliance on the unnatural False Front approach  
of cosmetics and plastic surgery. Instead, it has developed  
countless ways of breaking youthfulness  
down and destroying it. Those damaging activities  
that are not part of the search for the Great Reward  
seem to accumulate under the general heading of  
Saving Time.  
  
Goals are not fun. The moment just before is what is worth it. It is not anticipation, but awareness. But the realisation and happiness lasts just for a moment. What if we could extend it?  
  
T'zu: caring or compassion  
Wisdom and courage come only if kindness is present. Cor, Latin for heart, is the basis for the word courage.  
  
An empty mind is better than a cluttered, overstuffed mind full of knowledge or cleverness. The beauty of an empty landscape. As Claude Debussy said, "Music is the space between the notes"  
  
Loneliness doesn't come because of emptiness, but follows after all the spaces are filled. "After discarding the emptiness of the Big Congested Mess, we discover the fullness of Nothing"  
  
Abstract cleverness of mind only separates the thinker from reality. We think too much and care too little. Knowledgable people are more distressed than usual, but the wise are happier?
