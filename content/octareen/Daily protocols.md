# An Ideal Day
## Protocol 1: Record Your Daily Waking Time & Temperature Minimum
- Wake up and note the exact time at which you woke up. This determines your [[Temperature minimum]], which is 2 hours before your wake-up time.
- Why this matters: To determine when your super-focus time of the day will be

##  Protocol 2: Self-Generate Forward Motion (Outdoors)
- Get into immediate [[Forward Ambulation]]. Immediate walking, to stimulate optic flow, also auditory flow. Quietens the noise in the amygdala. Reduces levels of anxiety. Generating optic flow is important. [[Amygdala]] firing reduces. Alert, but not anxious.


## Protocol 3: View Natural Light For 10-30min Every Morning
- Sunlight in your eyes. Get outdoors, get sunlight for a min of 2 min, max of 30 min. Stimulate the [[Melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells]], which alerts your entire brain and body that hey it is daytime.
- Once a day on average, we face a healthy jump in the levels of [[Cortisol]]. It is super important that you get this cortisol pulse early in the day, getting it  later in the day is disruptive. You can stimulate it by getting sunlight early in the day.
- You want to be alert, put bright light above you or in front of you. Light in the eyes is what matters, just like sunlight in the eyes.
- Blue light is great for when you want to be alert. Blue blockers only in the evening.

## Protocol 4: Hydrate Correctly
- Hydrate first thing in the morning.
- Maybe add some sea salt, good for ionic transport that happens all over the body.


## Protocol 5: Delay Caffeine 90-120m After Waking
- [[Adenosine]] accumulates throughout the day, so you have your lowest adenosine in the morning.
- [[Caffeine]] acts as an adenosine competitive antagonist
- So you do caffeine first thing in the morning, and adenosine gets blocked off. Caffeine wears out towards noon, and that's when a **lower level of adenosine causes a bigger crash**
- This avoids the noon crash because you have a more even balance of hormones like [[Cortisol]] and [[Adenosine]] through the day.


## Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Until Noon
- Fasting increases levels of [[Epinephrine]] in the body, allowing for an alert but calm state of mind 
- We learn and work better when our levels of epinephrin are increased
- High levels of [[Epinephrine]] are associated with panic and anxiety, we don't want that




## Protocol 7: Optimize Deep Work: Visual Elevation, Ultradian Cycles, White Noise
### Visual elevation and posture
- Looking upwards, with your eyelids more open, heightens levels of alertness because they are associated with brainstem neurons that control the movements of the muscles in your eyes and eyelids
- So position your screen slightly higher than eye level
- Upright posture helps your levels of alertness too (locus ceruleus and reticular activating system). Reclining reduces levels of alertness

### Ultradian cycles
- Our day is divided into ultradian cycles
- 90 minutes of focus, then focus is lowest, then builds up again
- Use the bathroom in this 90 minute period? Don't
	- There's a direct connection between the bladder and the brainstem neurons which is associated with alertness, which is why when you need to pee, you're agitated and more alert.
	- So optimally fill up your bladder, hit the sweet spot of oh I need to pee but it can wait, because then you're actually at a heightened state of alertness
### Low level of white noise
- Optimal for focus, learning, memory
- No headphones, just low volume white noise
- Dopamine levels also go up

### When is the best time for deep work
- 4-6 hours after your [[Temperature minimum]]
- Temperature keeps increasing throughout the day
- The steepest slope of increase in temp is when you're going to be be able to focus best

## Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio
- Do some sort of physical exercise after your first 90 minute bout
- Working out for more than an hour causes a steeper increase in cortisol, which may be detrimental
- So stick to max one hour of workout
- At least 5 days of exercise per week
- 10-12 weeks of 3:2 Strength/hypertrophy: endurance
- Next 10-12 weeks of 3:2 endurance:strength
- Therefore a good balance between cardio and weight lifting
- [[Cortisol]] threshold is a thing, so be careful.
- Fasted training is great, amplifies cellular and liver health

## Protocol 9: Eat For Brain Function & Mood
- Stimulants before training is not great
- Alpha-GBC increases cognitive performance
- Large volume of food is always stupid, because it redirects blood to the gut which makes you sleepy
- Lower the amount of carb in the morning, but don't completely avoid it. Starches increase [[serotonin]] in the brain and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness
- Sufficient levels of EPA of omega 3 fatty acids increases cognition. 1000mg of EPA-DHA
- Selenium is important for thyroid function and regulate lethargy
- Brief 5-10 minute walk after a meal is good for metabolism.
- Getting out in the middle of the day is also beneficial for letting your body obtain information about the light and time of the day


##  Protocol 10: Get Your Testosterone & Estrogen In An Ideal Range
- Sex hormones have precursors in cholesterol, so adequate cholesterol is important too
- Fodogia is good to consume

## Protocol 11: Reset the Mind & Body, Enhance Neuroplasticity, Reveri.com

- Yoganidra, and other [[NSDR | Non-sleep deep rest]]
- Hypnosis accelerates [[neuroplasticity]]
- Dooo hypnosis. Specific areas of your brain related to executive function, focus, and the default brain network, ans insula -- enhances self-awareness



## Protocol 12: Hydrate Correctly, Nap Rules
- Keep hydrating throughout the day
- Nap rules:
	- 90 minutes or less
	- 20 minutes is optimal
	- 


## Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light To Support Sleep & Dopamine
- View light as the sun is going down 
- Lowers sensitivity of the retina to artificial light towards the end of the day
- [[Melatonin]] rhythm remains maintained
- Sunlight viewing stimulate [[melatonin]] release at the time thing

##  Protocol 14: Eat Dinner That Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep
- More carby, more starch, more [[serotonin]], but non-refined always
- [[Melatonin]] and [[serotonin]] have the same pathway, so 
- Replenishes [[glycogen]] stores too

## Protocol 15: Optimize Falling & Staying Asleep; Tools & Supplements That Work
- Drop in temp accelerates onset of sleepiness, and staying asleep. We heat-dump while asleep, which is why we stick an arm or leg or face out while asleep
- Hot baths help with this
- Growth Hormone is also released when you take 20 minute super foggy hot baths, which helps with recovery
- Taking [[Melatonin]] is not as safe
- But [[Magnesium]] threonate and biglycinate is a precursor to [[GABA]] which aids good sleep
- Magnesium + [[Apegenin]], which is found in chamomile is great for sleep too
- [[Theanine]] increases chloride channels and GABA, which reduces neuron firing
- So three of these together support neuron longevity and sleep

## Protocol 16: Preventing Middle of the Night Waking
- This happens because your melatonin pulse started earlier than when you decide to go asleep, and your cortisol pulse happens super early in the morning
- So either sleep earlier, or get more light in the evening
- [[NSDR]]s, yoga nidra help you relax and fall asleep

## Protocol 17: Weekends, Recovering From A Poor Nights Sleep
- One day a week of absolute reset
- Even if you don't sleep at the right time, wake up at the same time everyday
- 2-3 [[Deep work]] 90 min work blocks is optimal in a day
