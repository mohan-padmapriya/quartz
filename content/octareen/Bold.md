1. Billionaire --> idea that solves the problem of one billion people. What idea will solve the problem of one billion people?
2. Growth of tech, or anything, is not linear. Is exponential. Important when planning, or predicting the future of something. 
3. Digitalisation: "Once a process or product transitions from physical to digital, it becomes exponentially empowered"
4. Deception: Small change, initially. Can be mistaken for no change at all. But turnover is over the horizon. 
5. Disruption: creates a new market. Disrupts an existing one. Necessary for anything that marks a monumental change. 
6. Demonisation: LEARN FROM LINUX. Google. How do they even make money with everything free? Open Source is monumental, both philosophically and tangibly. 
7. Dematerialisation: What exactly? "Luxury technology eventually dematerialises"
8. Democratisation: Luxury technology becomes free, is democratic. Non
9. Fewer employees, less physical processes and facilities. 
10. Instagram: success piggybacking on the back of the smartphone explosion. What tech explosion can you piggyback on? 
11. Facebook vs Instagram. What's the difference, why is Facebook not popular anymore? Because of the simplicity, concentrating on a single thing? UI? 
12. "Seeing that made me realized that I wasn’t unique in having a good idea. What was unique where all the circumstances that lined up in order for me to execute on my idea. It hit me that it wasn’t just me. Invention is typically inaccessible. It’s really, really hard for everyone.”
13. Quirky --> interesting model; read more. Crowd-sourcing increases in speed, efficiency exponentially. Significant change to scale
14. Vison (like Telsa? vs Eddison's practical, very down to Earth approach)
15. COURT VISION EQUIVALENT PEWPEWPEW. Vision of the future that cannot be swayed
16. Deception and the Gartner Hype Cycle
17. Study Gartner Hype Cycle and make it relevant
18. 3D printing
19. Subtractive manufacturing
20. Space colonies? 3D printing and asteroid mining
21. 3D printing --> customisable. Biggest advantage. No preprocessed shit. On-demand fulfilment.
22. Padma Warrior
23. Sensors and networks. Read more. Super important. ur world is built upon these, and they've still gt such massive potential.
24. IoT
25. Infinite Computing
26. IMPORTANT: WHAT RESOURCES DO I HAVE ACCESS TO? WHAT STUF"S BEING IGNORED? A SURVEY. 
27. AI XPRIZE.
28. Orbem. Precision agriculture. Exactly this is required. Saving male chicks.
29. Watson in healthcare. Equivalent in another equally complex domain? 
30. Quantum computing is important. 1Qbit by SU. Look it up. 
31. Robotics and Baxter
32. Robotics in areas that require huge unskilled labour, and yet are the most boring to do. 
33. Genomics and Synthetic biology - DNA is essentially software -- personalised healthcare. Ayurveda poewered by synthetic biology?
34. Project Cyborg look up
35. NEXT STEP -- Find these tools online and begin experimenting. Change mindset as well. 
36. Longetivity. 
MINDSET
38. Kelly Johnson's 14 rules for going skunk
39. ONE: PURPOSE, AWE-INSPIRING, URGENT, LARGER-THAN-LIFE, FOR HUMANITY PURPOSE
40. FAIL EARLY, FAIL OFTEN, FAIL FORWARD
41. WORK IN ISOLATION? ALMOST, BECAUSE YOU MUST TAKE RISKS, AND DREAM CRAZY. BUT NOT COMPLETE ISOLATION. WORK AGILE. 
42. NOT MONEY, NOT AFTER 70K. AUTONOMY, MASTERY, PURPOSE

Flow triggers:
Environmental:
1. High consequences: Willing to take risk, willing to fail. 
2. Novelty, unpredictability, complexity. Pixar's atrium, how to encounter new ideas, and be in love with it?
3. Deep embodiment

Psychological:
4. Clear goals: but emphasis is on CLEAR not GOALS. Emphasis on goals is equivalent to emphasis on the future, on VoT, on podium moments. Emphasis is not on what has to be done now. Break into chunks. Think challenging yet manageable. 
5. Immediate feedback. Daily reviews. Put yourself out there. Improve. 
6. Challenge to skills ratio. Uncertainty is important, but not too much. Probably what's happening in the neuroscience course. 


Social:
7. Group flow

Creative:
8. Think different. Challenge every goddamned assumption. Be bothered by things that are impossible
