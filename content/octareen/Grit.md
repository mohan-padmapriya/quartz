> *Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.*

> *If you’re not as gritty as you want to be, ask yourself why.*

> - *If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to parenting encourages your child to emulate you. If the answer to the first question is “a great deal,” and your answer to the second is “very likely,” you’re already parenting for grit.*
# Ideas
## One 
- Holding the same top-level goals for a long time. And moving towards it.  A top level goal is like a [[Deep Work#Wildly Important goals]] that #CalNewport talks about. 

### How to prioritise
- Define top-level goal
- To what extent do the lower level goals serve a common purpose? To what extent are they aligned with the top level goal?
- Ditch low level goals if necessary 
	- [[The Dip | When to ditch and when to stick?]] 
## Two
- [[Talent vs effort#Naturalness bias]] is bad because it severely undermines the role of grit.

- Consistency is everything
	- How do you not give up? Or not quit?

## Three
- Grit = perseverance + [[Passion Hypothesis | Passion]]
> *Enthusiasm is common, endurance is rare*
> *What I mean by passion is not just that you have something you care about. What I mean is that you care about that same ultimate goal in an abiding, loyal, steady way. You are not capricious. Each day, you wake up thinking of the questions you fell asleep thinking about. You are, in a sense, pointing in the same direction, ever eager to take even the smallest step forward than to take a step to the side, toward some other destination. At the extreme, one might call your focus obsessive. Most of your actions derive their significance from their allegiance to your ultimate concern, your life philosophy. You have your priorities in order.*



## Four
- Grit is not a personality trait, it is [[neuroplasticity | plastic]].


## Five
- Interest development is important
- Interests are not discovered by introspection, but rather by interacting with the rest of the world.
- Longitudinal studies tracking learners confirm that overbearing parents and teachers erode intrinsic [[motivation]]
> - *At the start of an endeavor, we need encouragement and freedom to figure out what we enjoy. We need small wins. We need applause. Yes, we can handle a tincture of criticism and corrective feedback. Yes, we need to practice. But not too much and not too soon. Rush a beginner and you’ll bludgeon their budding interest. It’s very, very hard to get that back once you do.*


## Six
- [[Kaizen]] - resist the plateau of arrested development


## Seven
- How experts practice - deliberate practice
- ![](grit1.png)
- > - *Deliberate practice is for preparation. Flow is for performance.*
-  ![](grit2.png)


## Eight
- Grit and [[Growth Mindset]] go together

## Nine
> - *Often, the critical gritty-or-not decisions we make are a matter of identity more than anything else. Often, our passion and perseverance do not spring from a cold, calculating analysis of the costs and benefits of alternatives. Rather, the source of our strength is the person we know ourselves to be.*

#todo 
- How valid is the grit scale? If you're gritty, can you not have and pursue several interests simultaneously?
- Does maintaining a rigid top-level goal restrict growth? Where's the line between being gritty and being obsessive about something?
- #CalNewport on [[Passion Hypothesis]] vs how #AngelaDuckworth describes passion - what are the differences? Are they contrasting perspectives?
- Is there any such thing as intrinsic [[motivation]]?
- Do deliberate practice and [[flow]] happen together? *Deliberate practice is for preparation. Flow is for performance.* Justify or not.
- How are i[[Identity]] and grit related?
