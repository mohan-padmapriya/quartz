# Dopamine
> *Motivation, pursuit, drive, and to some extent, focus*


-------------------------
## To-do:
### To increase motivation
1. **Sunlight exposure to the eyes ideally within the first hour of the day, or at least within the first 3 hours.**
2. Eat [[L tyrosine]] rich foods 
3. Take B vitamins, particularly B6. But carefully, because excessive B6 can cause peripheral [[neuropathy]].
4. **No bright lights of any colour in phase 3, 17-23hr**


### To increase libido and feelings of well-being
1. Sunlight on your skin during the early hours of the day

### To increase the efficacy of dopamine receptors
1. Consume small amounts of [[Caffeine]] - tea, not coffee.

### To spike dopamine, relatively, and then crash.
1. Mucuna Pruriens - athmagupta - kaunch - literally 99 percent l dopa. But not recommended because its a real spike and crash
2. [[L tyrosine]]
3. Phenylethylamine - PEA powder - popular for muscle building and workouts. 
4. **[[Deliberate cold exposure]] - HUGE this is. Sitting in cold water (not cold water bath) tends to improve dopamine circulation drastically. Can be used as a replacement for prescription drugs.**

- Responsible for motivation
- Responsible for movement, for the function of the [[pyramidal circuitry]]

- [[Dopamine Scheduling]]
- Precursor to [[Epinephrine]]
- It is not always converted to epinephrine
- Released in several parts of the body, importantly the [[mesolimbic reward pathway]]
- [[Prefrontal cortex]] acts as a break on the dopamine
- It is released in anticipation, and works by narrowing our focus for the things we're craving
- Dopamine is responsible for wanting and craving
- Dopamine percentage increase in a 10ish seconds of consumption
	- Food you crave - 50% increase
	- Sex - 100% increase
	- [[Nicotine]] - 150% increase, and quickly
	- [[Cocaine]], [[Amphetamine]] - 1000% increase
	- Video games, social media?
	- Novelty seeking releases a bunch of dope
- However, just thinking about these things can cause the same percentage increase in 10ish seconds.

- [[Estrogen]] and [[Testosterone]] bias dopamine to be released

## Balance between pleasure and pain
- When you crave/anticipate something, dopamine is released and the circuit associated with pleasure fires us.
- But simultaneously, and often immediately, a mirror image of dopamine release, the pain circuitry is fired up too.
- This low level pain we don't perceive as physical pain, but the feeling of craving/wanting more of the same thing
- In a sense, the dope circuitry reinforces itself.

### [[Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility | Diminishing returns]]
- Each time dopamine is released, the pleasure circuitry fires us, the pain circuitry fires us, the subsequent experience of dope release and pleasure is diminished a little bit.
- **And, each subsequent time, the pain response increases, making you crave more intensely** 
- This is seen especially in drug seeking behaviour
- Our pursuit of pleasure is simply to reduce the pain of craving
- Hyper activation of the dopamine system is responsible for, among other things, [[Schizophrenia]]

## The yearning function
- Your desire for something is a function of how pleasureful it is AND how much pain/craving it induces when you don't have it

- [[Serotonin]] and other [[endocannabinoids]] bias us for interoception, to focus on things in the here and now, making us more content and satisfied
- [[Dopamine]] biases us for exteroception, to focus on things we don't have

## [[Reward prediction error]]
- We don't understand *maybe*

Collaborates with [[Testosterone]] in the same direction.


#todo 
- [ ] How is [[acetylcholine]] related to this?
- [ ] Why did brain circuits associated with dopamine evolve like this?
- [ ] Social media is associated with a pretty high percentage of dopamine release increase, but it tapers over time. But we remain addicted. Why is it that despite this taper in dopamine released, we remain addicted?
- [ ] [[Genetic bias towards addiction]] and dopamine, relation?
- [ ] How are [[serotonin]], [[oxytocin]], and [[prolactin]] associated with dopamine and the process of motivation?
- [ ] How are [[serotonin]], [[oxytocin]], and [[prolactin]] associated with the yearning function?
- [ ] Highly dopamenergic people can be manipulative. Is that a causation or correlation
- [ ] What are highly dopeminergic people - that have more dope/seek more dope in their system?
- [ ] Sociopathic people and dopamine?
- [ ] Dopamine levels and gifted kids who fail in college?
- [ ] Why do older people seem more settled, what does this have to do with dopamine?
- [ ] Does dopamine have a predictable graph with time?
- [ ] Isn't novelty a subjective thing? What determines our perception of novelty? 
- [ ] You can extend the dopamine arc cognitively. Is this why Absence creates more love or whatever? Or is that a completely different mechanism?
