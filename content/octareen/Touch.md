I do not like touch. Well, I don't really know what I like and what I don't. But anyway, touch is a topic, an experience, that I have complex emotions and ideas about. 

On a daily basis, Pa tries to pat my head, or caress my cheek, or place his palm on my arm, in a fatherly, innocent, affectionate way. But I hate it, I withdraw and make a scene immediatly. This happens repeatedly, every single day. 

Ma loves to konjify too. I let her, but I make it quite evident that I don't enjoy it. Keep saying thank you and enough awkwardly. I wonder what it would be like if I gave in, if I nuzzled up to ma when she kisses me. It is strange. 

I feel slightly uncomfortable writing, but not very much. 

I realise I am apprehensive putting these words down, and someone reading them. Not even someone else, I am ashamed to read them myself. But there is nothing to be ashamed of, is there. I don't know why I feel so dirty. 

I often feel this shame and guilt. I reckon it comes from Pa's ideas about physical intimacy, affection, love. Oh man, there's so much more to uncover.

From time to time, I relive the first time Rahul...
I am sooo uncomfortable writing about this. 

The first time Rahul put his head on my shoulder and slung his arm into mine. I froze. I don't know why I did, but I did. And I don't remember much else other than being acutely aware of the weight of his head on my shoulder. I froze, physicaaly, the entire cab ride. 

I was in general so uncomfortable and confused at any touch. Didn't know how to react. Didn't know what to say. 

That time we were in an embrace in the cab, and he slipped his palm inside my shirt. And he asked if it was okay. I wanted to scream and cry and say no. But I said a reluctant, silent okay. And I vividly remember the shame, the anger I was feeling at myself, the guilt, the feeling of having lost, having given up. I wanted to throw up, but I was just staring into nothing, feeling numb and frozen, as his fingers explored the skin of my chest. That feeling of deflation, hopelessness... Oh man. I was so ashamed. I just wanted to die. 

There was that day we decided to meet at his place in the evening, after college. I didn't want to go, but I didn't have the courage to say no. Instead I was pretending to want the same things he did. I remember feeling miserable at college, the battle in my mind, hoping somehow he'd get busy and I wouldn't have to go. And when classes got over, there I was in college, walking around aimlessly, lying to him that I was supposed to meet the principal. And just standing there in the 4 PM sunlight, wondering what on earth I was feeling. I didn't understand the fear or the confuison. 

I just want to stop and go to sleep now. 


Then I finally left college, went home. I remember how I was not moving at all, and how that was frustating. it was getting late, I was lying toRahul about why i was late, I was lying to ma about where I was going, I was feeling ugly and disgusting about myself. Then left home at around 6, got an auto to his place, feeling dread, shame, anger the entire way, Praying, for I don't know what, Just desperately praying, saying Ganesha save me over and over again. Save me from what? I vivdly remember climbing up the steps hoping a comet would hit me and I wouldn't have to go. The sky was a dark slate blue, dense, dramatic. I remember ringing the bell and him opening to the door to his dimly lit home. As we went to his room, he said no one was home. I panicked. I asked why he didn't tell me before, he said he thought if he told me, I wouldn't come. What was that supposed to mean? But I was soooo terrified, I froze again. We kissed, or I was just there, frozen, trying to reciprocate, but unable to. It wasn't long before his mum was back, much to my relief. 

But I hated it. I hated myself. I don't understand this.
