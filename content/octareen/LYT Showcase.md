# Showcase
1. Start with 000 home 
	1. A quote I stole from Gary
	2. Sort of cheatsheet, a regular reminder, a map, an algorithm of sorts


Here's my home note. It is nowhere near perfect, or completed, but for now my stay is comfortable. I've got a line that Gary said couple of days ago, right on top, to remind that everything is subject to change,and, like Valerie mentioned during her showcase, that order and structures are not eternal, everything is subject to change, and susceptible to chaos, which I want to tackle, to whatever extent possible, with grace, rather than panic. 

My home note is a sort of cheatsheet, a map, a sort of algorithm that inputs my emotion and recommends direction.

I often find myself overwhelmed, so this is helpful
Sometimes, I am feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder and awe for just anything and everything. People, things, colours, math, everything is fascinating. I am in a real mood to play, to do some sensemaking, to make thoughts speak to each other. Then, recommended action is to play with my graph view. Another nice space for thought collisions is the newsletter I've begun writing, which has an audience of 0! But it helps me sense-make, because I dump a dozen ideas at the end of the week and shuffle them around, play with them, introduce them to one another and see what comes out of it. Reminds me of a comment asher left on the forum. He said something along the lines of ideas emerge when two strangers begin a conversation on a plane. 

The third thing I like to do, is head to what I call my mental gym. Here I've got a bunch of imperfect, broken equipment which are fun, nonetheless. You can see how some of the new thought machinery I'm trying out I've stolen from Quirina, her ABT method, and Camilo and Nick, their prompts, and then Phil and Yolanda's Wicked Problems.

I am very blessed, I'm surrounded by the most fascinating, wonderful people ever, and so its not uncommon for me to feel overwhelmed by gratitude. It's easy for that to turn into guilt. To guard against that, I try to channel that gratitude into action and work on projects that are tangible, have solid outcomes, and allow me to contribute in whatever way possible. 

And then, I am overwhelmed by information. So often, soo often. I try to halt my consumption. Otherwise, I have this page, that's the japanese character for colour, read Iro, in which I've got a list of colour names. Colours, I associate with people, with smells, with sounds, with experiences. So I just click on a colour and try to write some stuff about the people, experiences, music, I associate with it. I could sit with a colour picker and hex codes all day and would never get tired.

Aaanyway, I'm not doing a very good job with the time, so I'm just going to skip to what I do, when I what I'm feeling is curiosity.
There is a popular to-do list plugin, that compiles a task list from across notes. I've modified it to suit my use-case, which is learning in the academic sense. Whenever I am learning something and I have questions, I will put it under the tag questions. All these questions are compiled and show up on my left.
This serves as a launchpad whenever I want to get back to learning, rather than starting where I left off on a note. For example, this is my note on Measurement, which is a super important phenomena in QM and QC. I put down whatever questions or meandering thoughts I have, and use this as a launchpad the for my next study session. Studying is a lot less linear, a lot more incremental this way. To illustrate what I mean, let's see, yes, so many questions turn into their own notes in time. 

And all this links back to my QC MOC, which I just call QC. Another thing I've been doing is for my thing notes, I have a why tag which is a sort of motivation, application, why I'm learning this secyion. Kinda to justify to myself why I am investing time into learning this. I would also like to link trending research in this section, that's something I'd like to work on too.

Let's see, what else, ah yes, tags. David Deutsch is a pioneer in the field of QC. I use tags to for people's names. This way I know which great is responsible for which ideas, but also acknowledge that ideas outlive humans, and are far more eternal than us. 

As a student, three other plugins I've found useful are anki_to_obsidian, which is great during tests and exams. The smart random note is fun. Andd, the incremental writing plugin, which I highly recommend.

## Notes 

Personally I don’t tend to annotate, I like to summarise. If you want to link back to check the exact wording you can put (p5.8) or something which would indicate something 4/5 of the way through page 5. That or just block quote it so it’s right there.

The benefit of adding obsidian on top of your setup would be that now your notes on the papers are in the wider PKM system and you can use them as sources to feed your collection/synthesis of ideas in a more effective way than in other systems.

## Design thinking
What I got from this video: Much of our best thinking is in the realm of prototyping, so if you want to solve a "wicked" problem (one that has unclear criteria for success and is not reusable because the conditions are so specific) it's best to basically try things that are analogous to the problem, which allows you to create better prototypes until you have a solution. This is called design thinking, and it's useful because most of our personal human problems are wicked problems (ex: how can I be happier? or should I marry this person?) and you can't solve them easily with logical thinking.

types of thinking/problems: 1. engineering - clear, repeatable solns 2. business - optimization 3. analytic - used in research; premise, slice, questioning process 4. wicked - criteria for success unclear & constantly changing; will know what's right answer only when you find it, & answer won't be reusable; human problems, messy problems; find soln via iterations, trial & error till you get an idea types of prototypes: 1. engineering - starts with conclusion, solution-oriented 2. design - starts with curiosity, user-oriented Prototypes in design similar to minimum viable product

## How do I take notes?
questions are important

new notes upon old notes. 

No domains, everything is everything.
Therefore, there will never be a note named after a class i'm taking, just the concept directly.

anddd the links matter so much!


I don't structure my notes. Everything goes in the same folder. The only structure imposed is the links

----------------------

## Flow
- Start off with an intro. Name, what I do. Name's Priya, I am an undergrad from Bluru. I love all things STEM, and also non-STEM. 
- 
- What is design thinking? Why is it important in stem? 

I use obsidian because I find that it is the most dynamic apps of the lot. My primary usecase is to sensemaking, play, talking. 
My obsidian is not a commonplace book, it is not well organised or structured. It is as messy as my brain, truly it is my second brain. 

1. I wanted something
	1. Less organisational or record, a system that is more real time, more raw
	2. don't care about how my notes look, i care about the ideas I can create








--------------------------------
As an example that has amused me over a career, every field of study thinks that they have invented eigenvalue analysis, which you’ll typically see referred to as PCA (Principle Components Analysis), SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), or whatever clever name they’ve come up with. The math is the same, but the context of the class it was taught in makes economists and engineers and statisticians all think it’s their own special technique. The Asimov essay I referred to above basically said that there are tons of examples of this underlying innovation. You go to school for Topic A, your first job introduces you to Topic B, you have a lunch conversation with someone who knows B but not A and they refer you to a paper on Topic C. You look deeper and find that the people who understand C could really benefit from A. Blammo, new idea! STEM fields can tend to be siloed, and cross-pollination of ideas can lead to real breakthroughs. The trick to the linking is that this is where _**your brain**_ comes in. Obsidian is not going to link your ideas for you. It just provides mechanisms for linking, searching, and visualizing that make this process easier.

## Script

Hello everyone! It's lovely to have you all here. My name is Priya, I am a student from Bengaluru, India. I'm doing my bacheolors in engineering, and I love everything STEM!

Now, before I get in to the topic of my presentation, here's some background. I took a year off 

A lot of people, includimng my own younger self, believe that STEM is a rigid field in which one cannot be as creative as they like.

In my presentation, I will demonstrate how that is not the case. In fact, there is a lot of play and exploration involved. 


Design thinking. 
**Design thinking is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, [challenge assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/challenge-assumptions "What is Challenge Assumptions?"), redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test.**

**Some of the essential characteristics of design thinking include empathy, collaboration, questioning, creativity, exploration, experimentation, and continuous improvement**




The tool I use is obsidian.

DICE is what I follow. There are 4 steps to my process, they are D - Discover. Discover the problem. Then there's Ideate - this is when the sensemaking, the idea collisions take place. Then we have the Creation phase - here I create a solution, or an idea, a literature note. And finally, there is E for evaluation. Evalution of the idea, or solution I have just spent time creating. 

This process is extremely unstructured, and iterative, and non-linear. But I enjoy the freedom that this sort of imperfection allows me. 

So, let's start with the first step, which is Discover. In this phase, we want to find the problem we want to be working on. There are two tools on obsidian that I use. 
The first is the to-do list plugin, which collects to-dos from various notes and presents them on your sidepane. I've accomodated this to my use-case, so now I take down questions
