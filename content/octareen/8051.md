# For tomorrow
- `MUL AB` not `MUL A,B`
- How you stop the processor - `Here: SJMP Here` or `RETURN` or END --> which is an assembler directive. The processor never *does nothing*
- Between sum and carry, C is the higher byte
- Why can't carry be 2?
- Lower byte - lower address, higher byte, higher address
- `JNC` - jump if no carry. 
	- Handle carries - 
		- `MOV R2, #00H` - you assume there is no carry
		- Program continues, addition is done
		- `JNC SKIP`
		- `INC R2`
		- `SKIP: ` - Carry is checked and stored at this point
- External RAM - only indirect addressing
	- Also you have MOV, and MOVX, but no ADDX, MULX etc. So you can't do these operations directly
	- Data can be transferred only using A register in ext RAM

## Block transfer programs
- Essentially copy pasting
- Use registers to point to addresses, because registers can be incremented inside loops
- R0, R1 used as pointer registers

### Internal to internal
Pointer for source - R0
Pointer for dest - R1

### Internal to external or vice versa
- DPTR for ext, R0 or something for int


### Ext to Ext
Only one pointer DPTR available. But you need one pointer for source, one ofr dest
- But r0 and r1 can be used, but super limited range

# The Pin Diagram
![](8051_pin_diagram.jpg)

- 40 pin IC with 64 functions. 24 pins have dual functionality.
- DIP - Dual inline package
## Pin 1.0 and 1.1:
- $XTAL1$ and $XTAL2$
	- Crystal oscillator pins - quartz crystal between two charged plates.
	- Crystal oscillates when plates are charged, and acts as a clock.
		- **Why does a processor need a clock?**
			- ***In order to trigger instructions. Processor freezes (and saves power) when the clock gets cut-off***
	- Frequency - **12 MHz**
		- **Why does the 8051 have a higher frequency compared to other popular ICs of the time?**
			- ***That's the advantage of a $\mu C$ over a $\mu P$ - all instructions are internal and therefore faster***
	- The external resonant is connected with this on-chip oscillator to make a complete oscillator.
	-  Max speed = max crystal frequency
-  If we decide to use an external oscillator, XTAL2 is left unconnected, and XTAL1 is connected to the external oscillator
 ## Pin 1.2:
- $RESET$
	- Power supply is cut-off and given back
	- Volatile memory refreshed (RAM, not ROM)
	- Programs (ROM) remain, data (RAM) is lost.
	- BIOS program executed.
	- Direction: Inwards


## Pin 1.3
- $ALE$: Address Latch Enable/$\bar{PROG}$
![](8051_ale.png)
	- 16 bit address bus is divided into 2 - $A_{15} -A_8$ and $A_7 - A_0$. The lower address lines are multiplexed with 8 data buses, making it $AD_7 - AD_0$. This is because at any point, address is fed before data, and never at the same time. Therefore, this arrangement is space saving.
	- The ALE indicates whether it is the address or data being fed to the multiplexed bus.
	- Direction of ALE - outward
- $\bar{PROG}$
	- EPROM program pulse is a program input pulse used during on-chip flash memory programming

## Pin 1.4
- $\bar{EA}$ - Enable External Access
	- Internal and external RAM are accessed independent of each other.
	- With ROM, the user has the choice whether to use Internal, then external ROM, or simply external ROM.
	- If $\bar{EA}$ is set to 0, external access is enabled, and internal ROM is discarded. If $\bar{EA}$ is set to 1, internal ROM is used, and external memory locations begin after internal memory locations. 
	- Direction: Inwards
<!--ID: 1625799981206-->

## Pin 1.5
- $\bar{PSEN}$ - Program status enable


## Pin 1.6 
- VCC - logic 1
- Variation of 10-2% is allowed depending on the variant of 8051.


## Pin 1.7 
- GND - logic 0





# Architecture
## Processor
![](8051_arc_processor.png)
<!--ID: 1625799981271-->

### Data
#### ALU
- Main function of the processor is to compute/process. Therefore it has the *ALU* (8). 
<!--ID: 1625799981287-->


#### Registers A and B
- The ALU does the computation, but operands are fed to it by *register A* (8) and *register B*(8). 
- Register A is called the *accumulator*, it accumulates the value after every arithmetic operation. 
- Multiplication and division are done specifically with register B only. 
<!--ID: 1625799981303-->


#### PSW
- The *PSW* (8) is the *program status word*, and it contains flags that indicate whether the operation is done or not. It can be read or written by the programmer.
<!--ID: 1625799981320-->



- These are connected to a 8 bit *address/data bus*.

### Address
#### Program Counter
- The *Program counter* (16) stores the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- It gets incremented automatically
- Instructions are always fetched in a sequential manner
<!--ID: 1625799981336-->


#### Data pointer
- Stores the value of the address of the data
- Can be read or written by the programmer, and is incremented/decremented/accessed randomly
- Data is not accessed sequentially, but randomly
- It can either be accessed as a 16 bit register or 2 8 bit registers - *DPH and DPL*
<!--ID: 1625799981353-->



## Memory
![](8051_arc_mem.png)
<!--ID: 1625799981370-->

### Internal 
#### Internal RAM
- Size : 128 bytes
- Therefore needs at least 7 bits to access
- Address start: 00H
- Address end: 7FH
- connected via an 8 bit bus
<!--ID: 1625799981387-->


#### Internal ROM
- Size : 4 KB
- Therefore needs at least 12 bits to access
- Address start: 0000H
- Address end: 0FFFH
- connected via an 16 bit bus
<!--ID: 1625799981404-->


### External
#### External RAM
- Size : 64 KB
- Therefore needs at least 16 bits to access
- Address start: 0000H
- Address end: FFFFH
- connected via an 16 bit bus
<!--ID: 1625799981420-->


#### External ROM
- Size : 64 KB
- Therefore needs at least 16 bits to access
- Address start: 0000H
- Address end: FFFFH
- connected via an 16 bit bus
<!--ID: 1625799981437-->


## I/O
![](8051_arc_io.png)
<!--ID: 1625799981454-->

### Ports
- 4 ports
- All 4 ports can give and receive data
- Only *Port 0* and *port 2* give/receive addresses
- Every port has its own latch 
<!--ID: 1625799981470-->


### Timer and control circuit



# PSW 
- Bit addressable 
- 8 bit
- ![](8051_psw.png)

## 1. Carry Flag
- Indicates whether there is a carry out of the MSB
- Intermediate carries do not matter

## 2. Auxiliary Carry Flag
- Indicates whether there is a carry from the lower nibble to the higher nibble

## 3. Parity
- Indicates whether there are an odd or even number of 1s in the result
- Zero 1s is even parity
<!--ID: 1625799981520-->

## 4. Overflow
- Sometimes, MSB gives you the wrong sign
- This happens when you overflow out of the signed numbers range
- Overflow = 1 indicates the sign is wrong
- Processor determines overflow by XORing C6 and C7
- If C6 and C7 are opposite, i.e, either one has a carry, then there is an overflow
- (C0 to C7 are the carry flags)
<!--ID: 1625799981538-->


### Signed and unsigned numbers
#### Signed numbers
- 128 Negative and 128 positive numbers
- Range: -80 to -01, 00 to 7F (-128 to -1 and 0 to 127)
- MSB 1 indicates negative number
- Negative numbers are stored as their 2s complement
- Magnitude = 7
<!--ID: 1625799981563-->


#### Unsigned numbers
- 256 positive numbers
- Range: 00 to FF (0 to 255)
- Magnitude = 8
<!--ID: 1625799981585-->


## 5. User defined flag
- Say, AC is ON or OFF
- Processor doesn't read or change this flag
- Use SETB and CLR, bit addressable, to manipulate it
<!--ID: 1625799981606-->


## 6,7. Register Bank Select
- *RS0* and *RS1*
- 4 banks
- 32 of the 128 bytes/locations of Internal RAM are general purpose 
- Each bank has R0 to R7
- Active bank is determined by the programmer, with the help of register bank select
- Default bank is bank 0, RS0 = 0, RS1 = 0
<!--ID: 1625799981624-->


## 8. Don't care

# Memory Organisation
## ROM
- AKA code memory/program memory/permanent memory
- MOVC
- Not independent of each other
- Both use 16 bit addresses


### Only Internal ROM
- 4KB
- Address Range - 0000H to 0FFFH
- $\bar{EA} = 1$




### Internal + External ROM
- 4 KB + max 60KB 
- Address range - 0000H to 0FFFH and 1000H to FFFFH
-  $\bar{EA} = 1/0$



### Only External ROM
- Discard internal ROM (still in the chip, but $\bar{EA}$)
- 64KB
- Address range - 0000H to FFFFH
-  $\bar{EA} = 0$





## RAM
- Both independent of each other
- Cannot discard internal RAM



### Internal RAM
- MOV
- 128 B
- 8 bit addresses

#### Structure
![](8051_memory.png)
- 128 locations
- Range: 00H to 7FH


##### Register Banks - 32B
- Only byte addressable
- Range: 00 to 1F
- Bank 0 to Bank 4
- PSW RS0 and RS1 bits decide which bank is active
- Bank 0 is the default active bank
- This division into banks reduces the number of opcodes dramatically (from 32 to 8 per instruction)
- To access R7 -
		- By name - The right bank must be active
		- By address - Access any bank anytime


##### Bit addressable area - 16B
- bit addressable 
- Range: 
	- 20 to 2F bytes
	- 00 to 7F bits (8 bits per byte, 128 or 7F bits in all)
- 128 bits available
- But also byte addressable
- To access a bit -
	- Special bit instructions - 12 in all

##### General purpose/Scratch pad RAM - 80B


##### Stack
- Data structure
- Set of memory locations operating in LIFO manner
- Example - text messages, social media feeds. etc.
- Only in internal RAM
- Stack grows upwards
- Limit is 7FH


###### SP
- Stack pointer
- 8 bit register
- Points to the address of the stack
- Default value - 07H in bank 0 (changeable)
- But, if you want to use the bit addressable feature, change SP to point at 30H, it is a register after all
- **Push**
	- SP <-- SP + 1
	- put data



- **Pop**
	- Pop data
	- SP <-- SP - 1


### External RAM
- MOVX
- 64 KB
- 16 bit addresses

## Special Function registers
- 21 in all
- Available to the programmer


### Bytes - the SFRs
- 21 opcodes for each instruction? That's too many
- Therefore, we allot SFRs addresses
- Therefore, they are accessed using different operands
- SFRs are allotted 8 bit addresses, in the internal RAM
- How do you make sure they don't clash with internal RAM?
-Remember, in internal RAM, 80 to FF are unused
Therefore, range of SFR addresses - ***80 to FF byte addresses*** , unused


### Bits - of the SFRs
- Again, all these SFRe bit addressable
- But if each bit had a separate instruction, again, you'd have 32 different opcodes per instruction
-  Therefore, they are accessed using different operands
- Therefore, in the bit addressable area of the internal RAM, you have ***80 to FF bit addresses*, unused




# Addressing Modes
- the manner in which operands are given in instructions
- *fetch - decode - execute*
- RAM, not ROM, because RAM contains the data you want to manipulate *(except indexed addressing mode, which is for ROM)*

> `MOV` works on internal RAM
> `MOVX` works on external RAM
> `MOVC` until address 1000, if the signal $\bar{EA} = 1$, works on internal ROM, and then external ROM
> `MOVC` , if the signal $\bar{EA} = 0$, works on external ROM

## Immediate
- data/operand in the instruction
- *#* indicates that the number is data, not address
- Without *#*, it is an address
<!--ID: 1625799981858-->


> Examples
	>-  `MOV A, #25H;`
	>-  `MOV DPTR, #2000H;`


## Register
- data/operand in the register, not n the instruction
- Use R0 to R7, doesn't add to the number of opcodes
<!--ID: 1625799981875-->


> Examples
	>-  `MOV A, R1;`
	>-  `MOV R0, A;`

## Direct
- Address is given in the instruction
- Address can only be an 8 bit address, to reduce size of the instructions
- *Therefore. only for internal RAM and SFRs*
<!--ID: 1625799981895-->


> Examples
	>-  `MOV A, 25H;`
	>-  `MOV 30H, #30H;`
	>- `MOV 01H, 00H;`
	>- `MOV A, 80H;`

## Indirect 
- Address given in a register
-  Use R0 to R7, adds to the number of opcodes. Therefore, only certain registers allowed
-  *For internal and external RAM*
<!--ID: 1625799981915-->


### Internal RAM
- 8 bit addresses
- *R0/R1*
- Gets easy when you want to access sequential data kept in a series of locations, like an array
- Loops and increments are possible


> Examples
	>-  `MOV A, @R1;`
		>- A gets the data from the location whose address is pointed by R1
		>- If 30H is in R1, we look at whatever is stored in the location 30H
	>-  `MOV @R0, A;`



### External RAM
> Examples
	>-  `MOVX A, @DPTR;`
		>- A gets the data from the location whose address is pointed by DPTR
		>- If 30H is in DPTR, we look at whatever is stored in the location 30H
	>-  `MOV @DPTR, A;`
	>-  `MOVX A, @R1;`
	>
#### 16 bit addresses
- *DPTR*
<!--ID: 1625799981934-->


#### 8 bit addresses
- *R0/R1*
- Assumes higher byte to be 0
- 00 to FF range
- But super small range, so no one uses it really
<!--ID: 1625799981951-->



## Indexed
- *For ROM only*
- Address is given as a sum of two registers - one acts as the base of the array, the other acts as an index in the array
- ROM also stores some static data, stored in look up tables
- How do you access LUTs? Using this addressing mode
- For example, 7 segment codes for numbers are never going to change
- These codes are stored in an LUT in the ROM
- If you store a LUT in the RAM, it will get wiped out because it is volatile
- Since this is an LUT, you can simply use an index once the initial index is moved to DPTR or whatever register
<!--ID: 1625799981968-->

# Instruction Set
## Arithmetic

#### 18.  `XRL 25H, A;`

### Rotate
- Work only  on A register
- To check whether terminal bit is 0 or 1
- Use with carry if you want to retain carry as well
- Is the number even or odd/positive or negative/number of ones
- Rotating left is multiplying by two
- Rotating right is dividing by two
- Rotate without carry four times to interchange nibbles

- ![](8051_xchd.png)


## Branch Instructions
- To branch is to change the address in the PC


### Unconditional Jumps
#### 1. `SJMP relative-address;`
- Short jump
- relative-address - how far ahead you want to jump
- **new address ** = PC + R_add
- current position is reference
- r_add should be calculated from the next rather than current instruction, because by the time you fetch the instruction with r_add, PC has already been incremented
- But instructions are at least 2 bytes, therefore r_add is calculated 2 bytes after current byte
- **size** 2 B
- **Range** - range of an 8 bit signed number - -128 to 127
- Signed because you jump backwards too
- ***All conditional jumps are short jumps (JC, JNC, JZ, JNZ, etc)*



#### 2. `AJMP s_add;`
- Absolute
- **Size** - 2B
- More range than short jump, but still a 2 B instruction
- ROM is divided into pages of 2KB each, so 32 pages
- How do you know where a page ends?
	- Each page is 2KB
	- 2KB = $2^{11}$
	- So page end address = 11 ones from the right, and copy the rest same as page start address
- If you are in the same page, upper 5 bits remain the same, only lower 11 change
- With AJMP, you can jump from anywhere to anywhere within a page
- **Range** - 2000B (compared to 128 bytes)
- **New address:** - 16 bit address required by the PC. That's 2 bytes. But we want to shorten operand to just one byte. So operand is a 1 B 8 bit lower byte of the address. This is s_add. 8 bits left. Out of those 8, 5 remain the same because we're n the same page. 3 left. Those three are provided by the opcode itself. AJMP has $2^3$ = 8 opcodes.
	- ![](8051_ajmp.png)
- Each AJMP opcode pertains to each one of the 8 addresses on the page.
- Problem with AJMP is that it consumes 8 opcodes
- Which is why all conditional jumps re SJMP, not AJMP



#### 3. `LJMP l_add;`
- Long jump
- 5000 is put into PC, the address of the next instruction
- n**ew address** - l_add
- **Range:** Longest - 64KB - 0000 to FFFF
- **Size of the instruction**: 3 bytes
	- LJMP (1 B) ladd (long address - 2 B)
- In a program, you don't know the address, therefore we use a label
- Assembler substitutes label with the address


### Calls
- Processor pushes return address into the stack from the PC, then subroutine address goes into PC, then execute subroutine, the return to the return address by pop PC
- Number of push = number of pops during a subroutine
- Nested subroutines and stack - beautiful combination



#### 4. `ACALL sub;`
#### 5. `LCALL sub;`

### Returns
#### 6. `RET`
- For ordinary subroutines

#### 7. `RETI`
- Return from ISR
- Specifically for ISRs (Interrupts are disabled)
- Also re-enables interrupts



### Conditional Jumps

#### `CJNE`
- Compare and jump if not equal
- X, Y, label


##### 8. `CJNE A, #25H, label;`
##### 9.  `CJNE A, 25H, label;`
##### 10. `CJNE R0, #25H, label`
##### 11. `CJNE @R0, #25H, label`

#### `DJNZ`
- Decrement and jump if not zero
- Use for loops
- `DJNZ count, label;`



##### Infinite loops
- Unconditional jumps to a backward location
- Say making a clock
- Use only SJMP label
 
 ##### Finite loops
 - Don't keep count in A, don't block it 
 - Don't use R0 R1, because they're the only registers you can use as pointers
 - Use DJNZ


###### 12. `DJNZ R7, Back;`
###### 13. `DJNZ 25H, Back;`
- Not usually used, because you rarely run out of registers



#### With Carry flag
##### 14. `JC label;`
##### 15. `JNC label;`
#### With Accumulator
##### 16. `JZ label;`
##### 17. `JNZ label;`
##### 18. `JMP @A + DPTR;`
- PC takes value of A + DPTR





#### Bitwise/Boolean
##### 19. `JB bit label`
- jump if bit = 1



##### 20. `JNB bit, label;`
- jump if bit = 0



##### 21. `JBC bit, label;`
- Jump if bit and clear/complement
- Clears once jump



# Timers
- Software delay
	- Involves processor but cheaper
	- `NOP`
- Hardware delay
	- More expensive, but processor is kept free to do other operations
- Timer 0 and Timer 1
- 2 delays can be produced simultaneously 
- 16 bit timers, both (65,535 counts each)
- Both 16 bit up counters
- To hold the count --> SFRs. But SFRs are 8 bit. Therefore 4 + 2 more
- Timers use 6 out of 21 SFRs
- Counts every time clock pulse happens
- Timer overflow - FFFF to 0000
- Once timer is done, has finished counting, timer sends an interrupt to the processor
- **Timer overflow flag** - TF0 becomes 1, interrupt sent, ISR, and back. Upon coming back, TFo = 0 automatically when 
	- Used to store pending status of interrupts
	- If two interrupts occur together, processor should not forget that one of the interrupts still pending and yet to be serviced
	- 5 interrupts - 2 timer, 2 external, 1 serial port
- If you want to count 5, you load count (FFFF - 5 + 1) because overflow happens at the n+1th pulse
- count to be loaded = max count - desired count + 1
- Timers can use internal clock
	- Works as a timer - Frequency is 1 Mega hertz, therefore 1 microsecond per pulse
- Timers using T0 and T1 external clocks
	- Works as a counter - Variable frequency

## TCON
- Timer control
- 8 bit register
- bit addressable register
- ![](8051_tcon.png)




### Timer Overflow Flags (2)
- TF1 and TF0
- Bit indicates timer has finished




### Timer Run bits (2)
- Set this bit to start timer
- **Software control **   - because these bits are controlled by instructions given by the programmer
	- Run bit has to be one for timer to be active
	- This is the primary control of the timer




### Interrupt external flags (2)
- Automatically cleared 



### Interrupt trigger flags (2)
- To decide whether interrupts should be edge or level triggered
- 1 = edge; 0 = level triggered




## TMOD
- Timer modes
- 8 bit register
- Identical nibbles



 ![](8051_tcon.png)

### Mode bits
- M0 and M1


### Counter/Timer
- C/Tbar
- Decides whether internal or external clock is used



### Gate
- Gate = enable
- Enables hardware control
	- **Hardware control** - user friendly, layman uses this
	- Switch connected to INT0 or 1
	- Lose interrupt function because it is now used to start and stop the timer (hardware control)
- Therefore, gate pin decides whether the INT0 INT1 pins behave as interrupt pins or hardware control pins for the timers
	- Counting is controlled by INTX
	- By default, used as interrupt

# Serial port 


------------------

#todo 
- [ ]   What are the advantages of a $\mu C$ over a $\mu P$? Do we use more $\mu C$s or $\mu P$s?
- [ ]  What is the difference between a data bus and a port?
- [ ]  What is the value of 10100001 if it is considered signed/unsigned?
- [ ]  Adding 7F (positive) and 01 (positive) gives you 10000000, which is negative. Why is this happening?
- [ ]  How did the processor determine there was an overflow? What is the formula?
- [ ]  Is having so many (32) general purpose registers a good thing or a bad thing? What is the point of having banks? Why not R0 to R31?
	- [ ]  To reduce number of opcodes. There are only 256 bits, 32 opcodes per instruction. That's too much.
- [ ]  Why only external ROM? Why discard internal ROM?
- [ ]  Why max external memory is 60/64 KB? What determines this?
- [ ]  How come the default value of SP is 07? Doesn't that interfere with the default register bank?
	- [ ]  Internal RAM has stack, external RAM doesn't have stack because SP is an 8 bit register. 
	- [ ]  On every push, SP gets incremented and stack grows upwards. If you want to give the stack max space to grow, it should start from the lowest location possible. If you start at 00, you're interfering with the default register bank. Therefore you start with 07, because although 07 is in register bank R0, we do push first, and first data is pushed from 08, thereby not interfering with 07 or R01
	- [ ]  But this is default lol, it can be changed
- [ ]  Why only 128B in internal RAM?
- [ ]  Why is `MOV R1, R0;` not allowed? Why is writing 2 RAM registers in a single instruction not allowed? But `MOV 01H, 00H;` is allowed. How are these two examples related, and what is going on?
	- [ ]  64 opcodes per instructions if you write 2 RAM registers in a single instruction, using direct addressing mode. This happens if you use the name of the registers
	- [ ]  But if you use the address of the registers, unique opcodes are not required
	- [ ]  Therefore, you can do register to register transfer using direct addressing mode
- [ ]   `MOV A, 80H;` - Doesn't 80H not exist? What's going on here?
- [ ]  How do you access a lookup table?
- [ ]  How would you decrement DPTR?
- [ ]  How do you know division by 0 has happened?
- [ ]  Do 99+99 with DA A
- [ ]  Error for `DNL A, #F0h;`. Why? 
- [ ]  Why software delays over hardware delays?
- [ ]  How do you know if an instruction is on a bit or byte?
- [ ]  Simulate the following circuit using a program
	- [ ]  ![](8051_bit-instructions.png)
- [ ]  Where to write MOVX, where MOV? Write a program to add two numbers in external RAM and store at a third location. How is this different between this and internal RAM?
	- [ ]  ![](8051_ext-ram-prog.png)
- [ ]  Why do instructions execute sequentially by default?
- [ ]  What is the difference between a jump and a call?
- [ ]  255 iterations - FF (max count possible in an 8 bit register). How do you generate 256 iterations?
- [ ]  T or F - Higher the count, higher the number of iterations?
	- [ ]  Initialise R7 to the value 0! After all, it decrements first and the checks. So decrements 0 to FF. 
- [ ]  What is the size of an opcode? 1 byte
- [ ]  Why do we have 3 types of jumps?
	- [ ]  LJMP can access entire 64KB memory
	> But it has size 3 bytes. Bigger the size, more the time required to execute
	> Therefore optimise, save a byte, save one cycle while fetching an instruction
	> JMPs, unlike ADD, are used in loops, and in every iteration there is a JMP, so every iteration is delayed by an extra microsecond if your instruction is a byte bigger
	> So makes sense to optimise, makes sense to have short and absolute jumps
	> Can't compromise opcode, so optimise the address, reduce the range
- [ ]  What is the difference between a timer and a counter? 
	- [ ]  Intention
	- [ ]  Nature of the clock
		- [ ]  If frequency of the clock is fixed - timer
		- [ ]  If frequency of the clock is not fixed - clock
>  - When a processor waits, does it *do nothing*? Does it consume power? 
>  - Are the TR0/1 and TF0/1 bits respectively complimentary? 
>  - Hardware control - what is the status of TMOD and consequently TCON?
