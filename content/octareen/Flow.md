Aristotle's definition of happiness and how the definition has evolved. Vs Indian and eastern definitions of happiness. 

We've got so much. We're almost more powerful than Gods. But our lives are filled with anxiety and boredom instead of happiness. 
Why?

Happiness is not something that happens. Not even a result of a good event. No direct path to it. 
Happiness must be cultivated and defended privately by each person. 

How does one go about being happy? First, achieve control over contents of your consciousness. 

Most forces are out of our control, yet these forces are the ones that shape our experiences and determine how we perceive our lives. Because of this, it is not surprising that we believe that our fate is primarily decided by external things. 

Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning
"Don't aim at success- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue... As the unintended side effect of one's dedication to a course greater than oneself" 

Optimal experience: Times when, despite our enormous lack of control of the factors that affect us, we feel in control of our own fate.
The experience of extraordinarily rich epiphanies in response to such simple, normal events. 

Usual belief:
Happiness is not during the passive, receptive, relaxing times. 
(Walk-in nature? What is the nature of that if not passive?)
Best moments usually occur when a person's body and mind are stretched to its limits voluntarily, to accomplish something worthwhile. 

Why optimal experience makes us feel so exhilarated, even though they might occur in times of struggle?
Because they add up to a sense of participation in determining our own life. 


Experiment
Although the experiences of life can be vastly different for people around the world, how did people feel when they enjoyed themselves?

Observation: 1st experts: led to the development of the concept of Flow. 
(Define flow and theoretical model)
Then asked people from all around the world. Optimal experiences were described in the same way by kids, teens, old women etc, from all around the world. 
Procedure: 1. Questionnaires and interviews
2. Experience Sampling Method; more efficient. People wearing electronic paging devices for a week, and write down how they feel the moment the pager signals. Random times. 

Books cannot teach you how to be happy. Because optimal experience depends on the ability to control what happens in consciousness moment by moment, which can only be achieved by individual efforts. 

How consciousness works, and how we can control it. Everything we feel- joy, pain etc, is represented in our minds as information. We must learn to control this information. 

The optimal state of inner experience: there is order in consciousness. This happens when energy is invested in opportunities that matter, that the skills match to. 
(Hence, the goal is only a temporary instrument that enables the individual to transcend or evolve his self)

Old stories there would be a quest before the happily ever after. That is just the metaphor that applies to the exploration of the psyche as well. Sadhana. 

Shields of culture philosophy art religion make us believe we're in control, but wears out after a while, and obstacles are back. 

Why are we discontent?
Reason happiness is so hard to achieve is because the universe was not designed with the comfort of human beings in mind. The Universe has scientific order with mathematical and physical factors, but does not take into account human comfort. 
Hence they are random in terms of the Order humans want to establish. 

Jh Holmes "The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly. It is simply indifferent. "
And we don't have control over the universe. Mastery of the external environment alone does not guarantee happiness. One must master consciousness. 


A thoroughly socialized person is one who desires only the rewards that
others around him have agreed he should long forâ€”rewards often grafted
onto genetically programmed desires. He may encounter thousands of
potentially fulfilling experiences, but he fails to notice them because they
are not the things he desires. What matters is not what he has now, but
what he might obtain if he does as others want
