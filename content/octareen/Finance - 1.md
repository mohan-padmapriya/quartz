## Start your portfolio
- Primary goal: Minimise risk
	- Do so by *diversifying*, or *spreading risks* across different industries, sectors, geographies
	#### Diversification
	- At least 30 stocks
	- Across industires
	- Across market capitalisation (classification by size of the total value of their outstanding public stock) 
	- International and emerging markets
	- Precious metals
- Dollar cost averaging - you buy smaller blocks of the same security over time to reach the investment position you want, instead of making large lump sum purchases. 
- *Sharpe ratio:* excess return or reward that you're getting per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the greater the return for the same amount of risk. 

#### Tip: Go with your gut. Buy according to your field of expertise
#### Tip: Invest in what you know

General rules:
- Ride your winners, cut your losses
- Don't get attached to stocks
- Don't ever lose more than 10 percent on any single trade (set up stop loss order)
- Diversify, diversify, diversify
- Don't focus on one particular stock; pay attention to market tops
- Pay attention to relationship between volume and index - *Now at some point in a bull market, the volume will start to fade as the index continues to be strong. That's a bad sign. *
- Watch relationship between volume and your stock price, *the stock that you have invested. Low volume doesn't tell us much, but arge volume tends to help support price movements. *
- Track the activity for the volume price activity for four or five days during that time period. Precedes overall market downturn.
- Sell into rallies that have fading volume
- Have an exit plan and target for every single stock

## Currency Trading
- Currency traded against each other --> pairs
- Crosses: Cross currency pairs (Sell JPY against GBP) --> Sterling Yen Cross
- Sterling-Yen: Yen cross (Strong/base currency/Asset - Weak/counter currency/Numeraire)
- Going long: refers to a market position that you borrow a security. In effect, it reflects to having bought a currency pair. When you're long, you're looking for prices to move higher so you can sell at a higher price than where you bought. When you want to close a long position, you have to sell what you bought. If you're buying at multiple price levels, you're adding to longs and getting longer. 
- A short position, or simply a short, refers to a market position in which you've sold a security that you never owned. In the stock market, for instance, selling a stock short requires borrowing the stock so that you can sell it. In foreign markets, it means you sold a currency pair, meaning you've sold the base currency and bought the counter currency or the numeraire. You're still making an exchange, just in the opposite order and according to the currency pair recording terms. 
- Having no position in the market is actually called being square or flat.
If you have an open position and you want to close it, it's called squaring up.
If you're short, you need to buy to square up.
If you're long, you need to sell to go flat.
The only time you have no market exposure or
financial risk is when you are square or when you are flat. 

### Profit and Loss
- Margin balance, margin requirements, and liquidations
- you will need to put cash as collateral to support the margin requirement.
And the margin requirement is established by a broker.
That initial margin deposit becomes your opening margin balance and
is the basis on which all your subsequent trades are collateralized. And maintain leverage ratio, or broker closes off your open. 
- Unrealised and realised profit and loss: Mark to market
- Your margin balance is the sum of your initial margin deposit, your unrealized P&L, and your realized P&L
- PIPs : Smallest increment of price fluctuations in currency prices (aka points)
- Bid(sell the base currency) and offer(buy the base currency)  spreads
- Bid is always lower than offer
- Generally, the more liquid the currency pairs, the narrow the spread. The less liquid the currency pair, the wider the spread. 

### Short term high frequency trading
- Jobbing and scalping the market or Rhythm trading
### Medium term directional trading
- momentum or swing

### Trading plans:
1. Determine position size
2. Deciding when to enter position
3. Determine stop loss and take profit levels

--> FOCUS ON PIPs
