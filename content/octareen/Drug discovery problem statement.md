## Costs
The process of discovering and developing a drug can take over a decade and costs US$2.8 billion on average. Even then, nine out of ten therapeutic molecules fail Phase II clinical trials and regulatory approval [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0155), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0160)


## Specific problems 

## Screening of a drug
Hence, drug target binding affinity (DTBA) is vital to predict drug–target interactions. AI-based methods can measure the binding affinity of a drug by considering either the features or similarities of the drug and its target. Feature-based interactions recognize the chemical moieties of the drug and that of the target to determine the feature vectors. By contrast, in similarity-based interaction, the similarity between drug and target is considered, and it is assumed that similar drugs will interact with the same targets

## A more specific problem statement
Oweing to the *too much data to be explored*, there is a need of something that will make drug blueprints for all kinds of targets more easily creatable and available. 




## Solution general:
The vast chemical space, comprising >1060 molecules, fosters the development of a large number of drug molecules [[19]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0095). However, the lack of advanced technologies limits the drug development process, making it a time-consuming and expensive task, which can be addressed by using AI [[15]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0075). AI can recognize hit and lead compounds, and provide a quicker validation of the drug target and optimization of the drug structure design [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0095), [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/#bib0100).


## Solution specifics:
***Quantum Generative Models for Small Molecule [[Drug Discovery]]***
By exploiting patterns in massive datasets, these models can distill salient features that characterize the molecules. [[GAN|Generative Adversarial Networks]] (GANs) discover drug candidates by generating molecular structures that obey chemical and physical properties and show affinity towards binding with the receptor for a target disease. However, classical GANs cannot explore certain regions of the chemical space and suffer from curse-of-dimensionality. A full quantum [[GAN]] may require more than 90 qubits even to generate QM9-like small molecules. We propose a qubit-efficient quantum [[GAN]] with a hybrid generator (QGAN-HG) to learn richer representation of molecules via searching exponentially large chemical space with few qubits more efficiently than classical [[GAN]].
