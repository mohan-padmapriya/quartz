- [[Acetylcarnitine]]
- [[phenylethylamine]]
- [[Pleasure pathway]]


# #AndrewHubermann Podcast on depression
## Pleasure system
- [[Dopamine]] is released when we're in pursuit of something
- There is a tilt in the pleasure-pain system when this happens. And the pain we interpret as *craving*.
- In time, we derive less pleasure and more pain (more craving) for the same amount of dopamine released - [[Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility]]
- ***Reset: Engaging in activities in which we are not in pursuit of pleasure, states in which we are bored***

## Major depression
- Different from [[Bipolar disorder]]
- ***The dissection tool to diagnose depression is [[Language]]***
- 

### Symptoms
- Crying easily when you didn't before
- [[Anhedonia]] - absence of enjoyment when there was some before
- [[Anxiety]]
- Guilt
-  Anti-self [[Confabulation]] - As mentioned in [[Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy]]
-  Vegetative symptoms - symptoms of the [[Autonomic Nervous system]]
	-  Early waking and not being able to fall back asleep despite being exhausted
	-  Lack of [[appetite]]
	-  ***These are definite physiological symptoms***
	-  [[Cortisol]] which is secreted in the early part of the day is shifted to late in the day, and this screws with wakefulness and sleep and everything
		-  9 PM peak in [[Cortisol]] is an indication of depression
-  Relates to excessive [[Inflammation]]
 
### Sleep and depression
- Architecture of [[Slow wave sleep]] that precedes [[REM sleep]] is disrupted if you have major depression

### [[Biology]] of depression
Something is wrong with -
- [[Norepinephrine]] pathways - associated with [[Psychomotor retardation]], with activity and alertness
- [[Pleasure pathway]] or [[Dopamine]] pathways - associated with the [[Anhedonia]], the ability to seek and obtain pleasure
- [[serotonin]] pathways - associated with the more cognitive, emotional aspects like grief and guilt


#### Drugs
##### [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[MAO inhibitors]]
- Work by increasing the amount of [[Norepinephrine]] in the brain (and sometimes even in the body)
- Bunch of side effects, includes crewing with [[Blood pressure]]

##### [[SSRI]]
- Selective [[serotonin]] re-uptake inhibitors
- Doesn't help with everyone
- Bunch of side effects


##### [[NDRI]]
- [[Norepinephrine]][[Dopamine]] reuptake inhibitor


#### Pain
- [[Painkillers]] can relieve people with emotional pain
- [[Substance P]] inhibitors help with depression
- Depression makes you hypersensitive to pain

## [[Hormones]]
### [[Thyroid]]
- Low thyroid is associated with depression - They've got [[Thyroid#Hypothyroid]]ism
	- Low energy, low metabolism
- [[Postpartum depression]] is thought to be linked to the thyroid system as well as the [[cortisol]] system
- Also [[Menstruation]], specifically during [[Menstruation#Menopause]] and [[Menstruation#Post menopause]]

### [[Cortisol]]
- More stress is correlated with more bouts of major depression across the lifespan
- ***Control stress system to avoid bouts of depression***
	- How do you counter [[Stress]]?

## Genetic predisposition to depression
- If you have this [[Polymorphism]], the [[HTTLPR gene]], your susceptibility to experience depression increases greatly. So from 5-6 bouts of stress = lapse into depression to 1 bout of stress = lapse into depression
- The more closely related you are to someone who's got major depression, the more likely it is that you will get major depression
- ***Therefore, learn to mitigate [[Stress]]***

# Tools
- Regulate [[Thyroid]]
- Mitigate [[Stress]]

***How?***

## Cold showers
- Release [[Norepinephrine]] and [[Epinephrine]], so if you're low on that, great

## Exercise
- Releases [[Norepinephrine]] and [[Epinephrine]] again. Also regulates [[Dopamine]] and [[serotonin]].


## [[Inflammation]]
- Reduce [[Inflammation]] and associated pathways
- Chronic inflammation is linked to major depression
- Inflammatory [[Cytokines]], [[Tumor necrosis alpha]], [[C reactive protien]], [[Interferons]], [[Prostoglandins]]
- Now, [[Prostoglandins]] can pass through the [[Blood brain barrier]]
- When we are chronically stressed, the communication between the [[Glial cells]] and the [[neurons]] becomes disrupted.
- Inflammatory [[Cytokines]] inhibit the synthesis of [[Norepinephrine]], [[Dopamine]], and [[serotonin]]
- [[Omega 3#EPA]] can offset the action of these cytokines.
- So [[tryptophan]] is usually converted to [[serotonin]], but this mechanism is disrupted by chronic stress. 
- Inflammatory [[Cytokines]] prevent [[tryptophan]] from being converted to [[serotonin]], but direct it down a different pathway
- So because of inflammation, instead of becoming serotonin, tryptophan is becoming a [[Neurotoxin]] which is pro-depressive.

### To-do to reduce inflammation
#### [[Omega 3#EPA]]
- Increase consumption of [[Omega 3]]s.
- [[Omega 3#EPA]] actually relieves symptoms of depression almost as much as [[SSRI]]s
- EPA limits inflammatory [[Cytokines]] so that tryptophan is converted into serotonin instead of [[Quinolinic acid]].

#### Exercise
*150-180 minutes per week of cardio; *
- Also has a positive effect.
- Exercise diverts [[Kynurenine]] into the muscle so that it isn't converted into the [[Neurotoxin]] [[Quinolinic acid]]

#### [[Probiotics]]
- Keep inflammation at bay and therefore help
- Keep the [[Gut microbiome]] happy
#### [[Creatine]]
- Increasing the activity in the [[Creatine#phosphocreatine system]] in the [[forebrain]] can be useful in regulating mood
- Enhances effect of [[SSRs]] in women with major depressive disorder
	- Oral Creatine monohydrate
- About 10g of creatine supplementation a day also improves the communication between the [[Creatine#phospocreatine system]] and [[NMDA receptors]]
### [[Layer 5]]
#### [[Ketamine]]
#### [[PCP]]
#### [[Psilocybin]]

# [[Diets#Ketogenic]]


# Summary and to-do
1. Do not overwhelm the pleasure system. Watch out for highly dopaminergic activities
2. Cold showers
3. [[Pranayama]]
4. Exercise - 150-180 min of moderate cardio (about 20-25 minutes a day)
5. EPAs - 1000mcg a say
6. Creatine - 3-5g a day
7. Fermented food - probiotics everyday

#todo 
- [ ] Is depression just something people are doing to themselves or is there physiological changes that happen?
	- [ ] [[Slow wave sleep]] is disrupted, brain patterns during sleep are disrupted, therefore definite physiological factors, decreased appetite which is not just because of anhedonia
- [ ] How many of these are causation and how many correlation?
- [ ] Is there a genetic basis to depression?
- [ ] Can you test for the [[HTTLPR gene]]? What can you do if you've got it?
- [ ] Vegans don't get [[Omega 3#EPA]] directly. What to do?
- [ ] Do depressed people crave more carbs?
	- [ ] [[Carbohydrates]] are our source of [[tryptophan]], which is a precursor of [[serotonin]].
