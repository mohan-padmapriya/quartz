# Motivation
Conventionally - 

*Eg: Hari hasn't done well on a test*
1. (Immediate) Reward - *Come on Hari, you've got this. if you do well, i'll give you 10 bucks. *
2. (Immeidate) Punishment - *You've done terribly, no screens for a month!*
3. ***Potential reward - *You did okay, but it'll be really nice if next time, you got a 100/100 so you could win the prize****
	1. We dont focus on this enough

### On visualisation
If you want to **start** - 
Visualising failure is far more effective than visualising success.

To **continue** - 
- Potential reward method 
- [[Random Intermittent Reward]]

- The chemistry of motivation is tightly wound up to the neurochemistry of movement - [[Dopamine]].
-  Dopamine for motivation is about balancing pleasure and pain
-  When you're doing nothing, the level of firing and activity in your [[mesolimbic reward pathway]] is low, [[dopamine]] is being released like 3-4 times per second.
-  But when you begun thinking about something that excites you, the activity increases exponentially, and induces action or desire to move in the direction of the craving. 
-  The anticipation is what matters.
-  The way dopamine works, ***our pursuit of pleasure is simply to reduce the pain of craving***
-  Dopamine is not as much about increasing pleasure ad much as it is about the motivation to pursue more in order to reduce the amount of pain/craving
- The yearning function
- Your desire for something is a function of how pleasureful it is AND how much pain/craving it induces when you don't have it
- 
- [[Serotonin]] and other [[endocannabinoids]] bias us for inter-reception, to focus on things in the here and now, making us more content and satisfied
- [[Dopamine]] biases us for extra-reception, to focus on things we don't have
- Creating a balance between the two is super important

## Pleasure
- Pleasure is two-fold
- The pleasure of pursuit, and the pleasure in here and now
- The highly driven, hustling people should try to extend their dope arc and try to put emphasis on the here and now
- [[Dopamine-Serotonin parenting]]
## The almond meditation
#JonKabatZinn
- A meditation in which you eat a single almond and train yourself to focus completely on the the experience, enjoy it truly and completely
- In doing so, you're tipping the scale which is primed to favour anticipation and craving, the exteroception [[Dopamine]] side of it, to the here and now [[serotonin]], in the present, forgetting everything else [[endocannabinoids]].

- Extending the same method, for any behaviour, you could train yourself to shift from the dopamine to the serotonin-endocannabonoid while approaching/behaving it.

## Two types of procrastinators
### Panic-of-last-minute loving type
- Love the stress of the impending deadline
- They're tapping into the [[Epinephrine]] system
- For these people, other ways of getting into action like [[Super oxygenated breating]], which will pump some adrenaline into your system and give you that narrow focus to work
- [[Caffeine]] releases dopamine, creates a 30% increase in firing of the neurons in the nucleaus accumbens of the [[mesolimbic reward pathway]] 
- [[L tyrosine]] which is a precursor of dopamine, present in certain nuts, soyabean, sesame seeds

### Not-enough-dope-in-the-sys people
- Wellbutrin, Mucuna purina - which is 99.9% L-DOPA, a precursor to [[Dopamine]]
- These people's bodies are not making enough dopamine
- So maybe see the doctor
- PEA or [[phenylethylamine]] releases both serotonin and dopamine

## Dopamine undermines itself
- So no matter how much you end up increasing the dope in your body, it's never going to enough because of the associated pain mechanism
- The growth mindset of setting goals and achieving more has an underlying flipside og the pain of unaccomplishment becoming more and more intense

## Sex
- There is a dramatic increase of dopamine in the the anticipation of sex
- After orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background, there is a dramatic decrease in dopamine and the increase in [[prolactin]]
- Prolactin is associated with stillness, and the lack of desire to pursue whatever released the dopamine
- Prolactin decides how long men last
-  But novelty, which releases more [[Dopamine]] again, can shorten this refractory period caused by the release of prolactin

### [[Dopamine]]-[[prolactin]] balance
- This mechanism between the two hormones, which evolved in the context of reproduction, can help you do something about your motivation
- After any major boost of dopamine inevitably comes a dimmed period of prolactin. So maybe take some B6 to offset it?

## Extending the dopamine arc
- Extend the pleasure cognitively, by looking back at the journey, at the experience, without having to engage in the behaviour again and again
- This also offsets some of the pain or craving that comes after the dope
-

## The difference between pleasure and drive
### Experiment
- Rats press a level to get food, pleasurable experience
- Rats injected so all their dopamine neurons are removed, press level, get food, pleasurable experience.
- Rats without dope moved one rat body length away, have no motivation to come press level
- Therefore, dopamine is about motivation to get pleasure, not pleasure itself

## [[Dopamine Scheduling]]

- Control, but not in a predictive way, celebrating your rewards. 
- Telling someone itself counts as a reward.
- So, maybe skip this one
- To engage long term enjoyment of pursuit
