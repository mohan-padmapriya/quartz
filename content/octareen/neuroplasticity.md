- The capacity of our brain/nervous system to transform, consciously.
- Centered around the [[Autonomic Nervous system]] - autonomic arousal system

# What you can do daily
## How to wake up earlier and easier - short term plasticity
- [[Chronotype]] 
- The [[Melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells]] and our [[circadian rhythm]] are connected
- These connections are plastic throughout your life.
- Getting sunlight in your eyes can prime or potentiate you for the anticipation of light. So over time, your body adjusts itself to wake up earlier.
- These [[Melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells]] are also connected to the adrenal gland. which is why viewing sunlight in the morning triggers the release of [[Cortisol]].
- Immediate [[Caffeine]] causes a mid-morning crash because the brain to adrenal connection is plastic as well - [[Caffeine]] competes with [[Adenosine]] receptors.

## Use states of high alertness to do shit you already know to do 
- Do strategy implementation
- Focused, not exactly creative or diffused, hard effort work
- Not exactly best suited for creativity
- Lectures, learning, stem of the T

## [[Go No-go]]
- When you have high levels of autonomic arousal, alertness, this circuit gets triggered more easily
- Some states of [[Autonomic Nervous system | autonomic arousal]] are biased to trigger Go, while others no-go

#### Should I listen to music while studying?
- Doesn't depend on the kind of person you are, or on the kind of stuff you're studying
- Depends on the level of [[Autonomic Nervous system | autonomic arousal]], and therefore whether it is the go or the no-go circuit which is triggered more

### When you're super alert - 
- [[Dopamine]] binds to D1, Go pathway is dominating
- No music, silence is better
- No internet, no distractions, even seemingly intellectual or academic ones
- When you're very alert, you're primed and biased toward action, of any kind, and suppressing action therefor will be difficult
- Therefore, best to do strategy implementation, less explorative, more defined tasks at such times
- Also, usually 3 hours after you wake up, or 5ish hours after you hit [[Temperature minimum]].

### Clear, calm, alert
- Sweet spot
- ideally do creativity type 1 here


### Drowsy, tired
- [[Dopamine]] binds with D2, no-go pathway dominates
- Background noise, music elevates levels of autonomic arousal because our [[auditory system]] and visual system are linked and are part of the [[Salience network]]
- Tasks which require less cognitive load
- Tasks that require more creativity, more ability to jump from one place to another, rather than that require linear subtask completion
- Creativity type 1, not type 2


## Optimising exercise
- Exercising when our temperature is rising, morning, leads to the release of [[endorphins]] and assists alertness in the late morning, early afternoon
- Within an hour to three hours of waking is optimal, because it primes your morning so that the go pathway dominates

## Optimising nutrition
- Fasted, low carb states lend themselves to alertness
- Carbs are rich in [[tryptophan]] a precursor to [[serotonin]], which enhance sleepiness
- Which is why you're likely to crash after eating
- Too much food is always a bad idea because eating diverts blood to the gut

- Eating --> states of calm
- Fasted states --> alertness

- If you wanted to bring down your level of alertness, eat something


## Optimising rest
- [[NSDR]] in the afternoon is great 
- Use the [[NSDR]] as a reset. Do a second bout of learning immediately after  that
- Groggy after the NSDR? Take a walk, generate [[Forward Ambulation]] and experience optic flow

## Use bouts after [[NSDR]] to do more creative stuff
- Creative stuff of the second kind though
- In which you work through your ideas to build something concrete and robust
- The more playful, exploratory stuff is better when you are sleepier, drowsier




# Creativity
## Explorative, brainstorming mode
- No-go pathway better for this
- States of drowsiness

## Linear, implementation mode
- Calm, clear, balance between both pathways
- or even the high alertness pathway

## Evening sunlight
- Delays when you wake up so that you don't wake up in the middle of the night




## Alertness before bedtime
- An hour before bedtime, there is this [[peptides]] released, which makes us super alert
- Historically, this is believed to be a signal to early humans to gather resources and prepare for bed

### Late night sudden anxiety is just a natural blip
- Passes in 45-60 minutes
- Do some organising then, but don't really bother too much. It'll pass.
- Maybe use that time for a review?!
