# Introduction
Broadly divide the investigation of the nature and origin of mathematics into two -
* [[Platonic mathematics]]
* Mathematics that is completely human, full of [[conceptual metaphor]]

The reason [[Platonic mathematics]] is even a contender is because, as [[Eugene Wigner]] famously points out, [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]] is not exactly _natural_. However, the fact that mathematics works cannot be cited as evidence for the argument that mathematics is inherent to the universe. Math, as we know it, is brimming with [[conceptual metaphors]]. 
> Conceptual metaphor: It is a grounded, inference preserving cross-domain mapping that allows us to use the inferential structure of one conceptual domain (geometry) to reason about the other (arithmetic). 


Conceptual metaphors are unique to the human mind. Hence, there can be no overlap beween platonic math and _human_ math. Platonic math is inherently literal.
==Are conceptual metaphors unique to the human mind?==
==What mechanism of the the brain allows it to comprehend, and not be confused by metaphors?==
==The metaphors "Numbers are points on a line", "Numbers are sets" become foundations for complex theories and domains of mathematics. How do people on the autism spectrum/ those with developmental disorders comprehend, and then create, based on these?==

# RAW
Chapter 1:
What is the most basic arithmetic? Surely the arithmetic babies can do. 
Babies can discriminate between number of shapes, number of sounds. 
Experiment: show a baby slides, babies get habituated and therefore fixation time reduces. Slide changes to three dots, and fixation time increases again. 

The violation-of-expectation paradigm --> Would a baby at 4.5 months expect, given the presence of one object that the addition of another would result in the presence of two objects?
Related to object permanence? 
Experiment: puppets
Do babies have a notion of order then? When does order arise out of this rudimentary number discerning? 

Essentially, babies are subitising. We all do, upto 4 objects. Animals do too. 
Experiment: Subitise and report immediately. Two import things ---> reaction time and accuracy. 
What are the neurological processes behind subitising? Serial processing? But brain damaged people can subitise, not process serially, as well (check why, check claim)
Experiment: rats perform activity a required number of times. Required number of times is estimated by the rats. How is the rat estimating? Subitising. (But rat experiment is serial processing proper no, like counting number of whistles when the pressure cooker is on? It is difficult to do. Not subitising. Therefore, is subitising purely visual? Alright, sounds in quick succession --> expectation involved? )

Monkeys and object permanence is there. Stronger reaction than in babies. Chimps can do arithmetic, and also do it with symbols. Chimp Ai from Kyoto Uni can. Read more. 

Symbolic numerical abilities, might have to do with the inferior parietal cortex. Evidence: epilepsia arithmetices and Mr. M, who cannot tell what comes between 3 and 5, but knows B comes between A and C, and Monday comes between Sun and Tue. It's not about sequence, only the symbols (but why is alphabet symbol stored differently compared to number names in the IPC? Alphabets are also essentially counting no? Notionof order...) Mr. M can't do basic arithmetic, but rote memory is great. He knows numerals and corresponding symbols. 

IPC --> Vision, audition, touch. Highly associative (aren't there other associative region of the brain). Challenge claimz read up online. Dehaene guy.
What's the association between numbers, writing, fingers, space?  Arithmetic. Therefore arithmetic is to do with IPC. (evidence is that's all?)
Are algebraic calc and arithmetic calc done in different brain regions? Apparently. But how? 

However, all this is barely math. More to do with rote mem and recognition, no? 

Chapter 2:
Most cognition is unconscious. Mathematical cognition too. We even have an unconscious memory --> Schacter 1996. Are the same cognitive mechanisms we use to characterise ordinary ideas also used to characterise mathematical ideas? Derivative mathematises the idea of instantaneous change, i mathematics the idea of rotation. 
Everyday conceptual apparatus that are central to math -
Image schemas: 
Example: container and orientation. Got a logic to them. Terry Reiger, using structured connectism -
4 features. 
Conclusion: container and orientation very central to math. Neural capacity for  Container and orientation not developed for math specifically. We have adapted other cognitive mechanisms for mathematical purposes. 
Orientation schema --> visual system. But there exists mental imagery, and dreams. And blind people can "see" too. Visual system doesn't rely solely on visual input. Additionally, it is linked to the motor system too (cat experiment.). Image schemas are kinesthetic. 

Motor control:
Motor schemas and aspectual schemas have the same superstructure. Rational inference uses the same neural facility, even in the lack of motor input. 
Aspect schema: reasoning about events and actions
Aspect schema uses same neural structure that's used in the control of complex motor schemas. 
 Perfective and imperfective aspect. 
 Then internal and external completion. 
 Math has these ideas too --> rotation starts and completes. 
Aspectual ideas are plenty in math. 

Source-path-goal image schema concerned mainly with motion. In math --> limits (?), Functions going up, down, reaching a max, lines meeting at a point. In language too --> fictive motion, like road running up, sea meeting shore. 
You can have a conceptual composition --> into schema is in and to schemas. Out of schema is out and from schemas. 

Conceptual metaphors: this is how we make the jump. And the mappings are systematic and not arbitrary. 
Eg: affection and warmth; hate and coldness
Importance and size
Similarity and physical closeness
Difficulty and physical weight/burden
Organisational structure and physical structure
States and locations --> in a funk, I'm in a better space now
Therefore, inferential structure if a concrete source domain gives structure to an abstract target domain

These parallels we begin making in childhood. Conflation (different areas of brain lighting up)

Logical inference is in fact spatial inference mapped onto an abstract logical domain. 

Container schema has a spatial logic inherent to it, which is mapped to categories and Boolean logic. Which is why Venn diagrams are natural. 
Therefore, something conceptual actually arises from that which is perceptual. 
All this is different from formal logic though. 

Conceptual metaphors also introduce new elements into the target domain. Business to love introduces idea of partnership to love. (But it's so natural!)
I'm putting in all the work. 

Conceptual blends:
Properties inherited by unit circle because of number plane and its own geometry vs normal circle.

Chapter 3
"Innate" ability to 1. Subitise and 2. Add/subtract small cardinal numbers. How/why "innate"?

Grounding and linking metaphors:
BUT extraneous metaphors --> ball rolling down hill - not integral to the structure of mathematics. VERY IMPORTANT STOP ROMANTICISING. 

What's the difference between grounding and extraneous? Think. 

How do metaphors preserve inference? Preserve image schema structure preserved. Projection of logic onto target, onto numbers. 

Arithmetic Is Object Collection
1. Cardinal/counting numbers to natural numbers. Why so natural?

Arithmetic as Object Collection
Why?
Ans. Childhood blocks and fingers addition result in neural level metaphor forming.
Metaphorical mapping consists of the source domain, the target domain, mapping itself

Implications on language, both ways. Numbers don't have size, and you can't really add apples
Many many properties, etc

"All arithmetic is not innate. Part of arithmetic rises from our experience in the world with object collections"

Why is multiplication cognitively more complex than add/subtraction?

Multiplication --> simultaneous activationof two domains along with the connections across domains.

M: Pooling or repeated addition. D: Splitting or repeated division. Regardless, both output a collection, therefore similar to add/sub. 

M and D are metaphoric blends. (Why?)
Pooling/ Splitting for commutative, associative, distributive props. 

Zero: absence of a collection should be a collection. But we don't see it like that. Therefore, in order to make this work, we add a metaphor. This metaphor is not a natural extension. 

Arithmetic as Object Construction--> somehow, we see numbers are "made of" or "composed of". Therefore, review of source and target domain. 

How are the object collection and object construction metaphors related? 

Measuring Sticks or counters are physical segments. Physical segments are numbers. But physical segments are continuous and unidimensional. Why is this a conceptual blend? 

Therefore, every number can be mapped to a physical segment. However, it's not that for every segment, there is a number (why?)
But there has to be. 
Why?
Use Number/Physical blend to create traingle and say root two must exist. 

Therefore, irrational numbers are born from the Number/PS blend and measuring stick metaphor. 

Arithmetic is Motion Along a Path.
Why are motion and physical segments related? 
Implications of this metaphor:
1. 0 doesn't have to be created, as with other metaphors. The origin is automatically 0
2. Natural extension to negative numbers. 

Linguistic examples of this -

Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra and x

4 grounding metaphors. And their implications. What do they entail for 0 and 1? Proof in language? 


4. Where do the laws of arithmetic come from?

Isomorphisms arise from structural correspondences in the 4 Gs
"The source domain of all four basic grounding metaphors for the arithmetic of natural numbers are isomorphic" how?

Implications of 4Gs
Numbers are Things in the World
1. If that's the case, numbers should have an objective existence as real entities here --> mathematical Platonism
2. Closure. Operation on thing will give you same kind of thing. 
This also led to n to z to q... To c

Numbers as whole put together out of parts derives from Arithmetic is Obj Cons. Therefore split into polynomials, do prime factorisation, infinite sums


Numerals. What if we had to do math in Roman numerals? Do different numeral systems have different implications for the same underlying arithmetic and numbers? 
.
Why do we use base 10 instead of 2? 10 fingers?
Why write linearly/prefer so many linear systems?
Sweep of arms/gaze

Basis of crude calculation (without understanding), of addition subtraction etc we learn --> numerals, not numbers. Subtle. 
Algorithms
Advantage: less cognitive load. Also therefore computers can do it. 

ERF --> One of the reasons the associative law works..
Then these 4Gs are stretched. Implications. 

What makes the arithmetic of natural numbers effective in the world? 4Gs

IMPORTANT: Go through the summary part. 

End of part 1. 





## Chapter 1: 
Experiments on [[babies and number discrimination]] give us the following insights/ inferences:
1. Babies can differentiate between 2 and 3 different sets of objects
2. Babies can discriminate between 2 and 3 different sounds
3. However, babies do not have a sense of order. They know 2 is different form 3 (and therefore react), but don't know that 3 is larger than 2. 

Essentially, they can [[subitise]], which is _the rapid, accurate, and confident judgments of numbers performed for small numbers of items. The term was coined in 1949 by E.L. Kaufman et al.,[1] and is derived from the Latin adjective subitus (meaning "sudden") and captures a feeling of immediately knowing how many items lie within the visual scene, when the number of items present falls within the subitizing range_

Rate of errors and time taken to recognise icreases linearly with the number of objects. One cannot subitise beyond four.

Subitising in animals: 
Rats, monkeys, subitise as well. Chimps, like Shaeba, can categorise. 
==Do they have a sense of order?==

Epilepsia arithmetices: observe fits during mathematical calculation or during games. Extremely rare, still exists. To do with the Inferior parietal cortex. 
==What about the inferior parietal cortex in animals? Is there a math component analogous to this in the animal brain?==
==Which part of the human brain is responsible for subitising?==
==Which part of the animal brain is responsible for subitising?==
==How is EA related to subitising?==
==How much of basic arithmetic is recognition?==
==What does EA prove with regards to the human nature of mathematics?==

> Not only is rote localised seperately from basic arithmetic abilities but algebraic abilties are localised seperately from the capacity for basic arithmetic abilities
