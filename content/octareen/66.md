## 4 most important skills
1. Resourcefulness - Reading widely
2. Problem solving - Understanding deeply
3. Emotional stability
4. No internet depth and creativity



# Rough

## Rules --> Minimal
1. Gowing as a person. What are the problems?
	- Scared, afraid, compplacent. Not gritty enough, not brave enough. Not doing, just thinking. Barely any exposure, barely any practical application. Not bold enough to explore, or try. Extremely sheltered.
		1. Scared, afraid, helpless: Reading books, therapy 
		2. Networking and feedback: Don't say NO by default. Take survey of current resources. Prioritise family.
		3. Complacency: Kill distractions, constantly reorient and pick yourself up. Re-establish default.
		4. Grit and braveness, mental strength: Read more, rethink default thoughts and responses to several situations. Are you anti-fragile?
		5. Action vs thought: Seek out situations that allow for feedback. Quit shortcuts, freeze anything shallow, superficial. Enforce depth. 
		6. Exposure: What underutilised situations are you in right now? Approach with a Elon-Musk-drag-everyone-into-the-light-with-you attitude
		7. Practical application: Learn in public, creator craftsman mindset. Make something. Anything at all. But spend time on it depending on potential monetary value.
		8. Sheltered, learned helplessness: Take risks, little acts of rebellion, driver's lisence

1. What is a belief that hasn't been challenged?
2. What is a truth that can potentially solve an unsolved problem, 




## Perhaps emulate solutions that have worked in developed countries, apply here in order to get a feel for it. Do quick, fail as many times as possible now. Get some practice, constantly look for an ignored aspect while doing so, don't get caught up. 

Okay so plan

1. Journal everyday
2. To-do at the start of every session. Plan meals and workout.
3. Read 8:30 to 9
4. No zero days. Zero on working towards goals, on water, on workout

Do math and writing and thinking in the morning

Ideally:
1. Wake up 3:30, brush, turn on laptop and put video/podcast. Reply to DKS, arun uncle
2. Plan writing, math, thinking. Specify. Play music while doing so.
3. 4 to 6:30 all this
4. Yoga, 20 minutes skipping, bath, shallow work
5. 9 to 4 session 2, planning is key, specially food and workout
6. 4 to 8 session 3, planning is key specially food and workout. Limit calls. 


## Getting fit
***Golden rule: Calorie deficit***

#### Watch out for:
1. Becoming impatient: 0.5 to 1% fat loss a week. Therefore at least 12 weeks to see considerable changes. 
2. Metabolic adaptations: Weigh everyday, but look at avearge weigh-in for the week. Do measurements and progress photos. Don't make any changes for at least 4 weeks, review only after 4 weeks. 
	1. If stuff is not working, either cut carbs or fats. Keep protiens up.
	2. Make sure you're active and moving around apart from the workout time. Set daily number of steps.
3. Water retention
- Cut out the stress. Meditate, journal, grow spiritually.
- Beware of shite period weeks. 
- Drink more water.
4. Make a good plan: 
- Sufficient protien intake
- Strength training, not too much cardio all the time
- Reasonable calorie deficit

#### To-do:
1. Phase it out: Drop a little, maintain, get comfortable, drop a bit more, maintain. Every 12 weeks.
2. Reduce your calorie intake. IF seems to work best, stick to it. Perhaps get in more pranayama so you can begin fasting as well. Or not.
3. Decide diet specifics:
	1. Set calorie intake: weight in lbs X 9-10 = 1170 cals
	2. Protien: A third of every meal has to be protien
		1. Dal/kootu
		2. Tofu
		3. Soya
	3. Carbs: No only carbs bullshit. No refined carbs. No fried shit. No sugary shit that's not a fruit. No sauces and processed shit. Eat good stuff bro.

#### IF specifics:
- 2 litres of water between waking up and first meal
- First meal: 1 cup salad, always. Plan salads for a week and execute.
- 2 intermediate meals, 1 cup each
- Drink tea in between. Tulsi, lemon, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon
- 4 hour main eating, 6 hour snacking window. 
- Last meal: Small cup of chia, oat, banana thing. Get badam, dates, soy milk, flax, sesame here. 

#### Workout: 
- Start of the day: Yoga + skipping/body weight
- End of the day: Shoulders + skipping/body weight

Supplements:
- Vitamin C
- B12
- Multivitamin
