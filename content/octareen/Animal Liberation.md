1.  Thomas Taylor's argument - Vindication of the rights of brutes  
    Men and women are similar, and hence deserve the same rights (?). There are differences between human and non-human animals, on the other hand. And this gives rise to a difference in rights. True, there are different rights. Women's right to an abortion. Men don't need one, similarly, cows don't need the right to vote. Different rights are okay.

Basic principle of equality

It is not about equal or identical treatment, but equal consideration.

Demand for equality cannot come from the actual equality of race, sex, creed, and therefore species. Humans are different. In several aspects. Differences must be acknowledged, and then, despite these differences, the basic principle of equality must be extended.

Q. Why is sexism/racism wrong?  
Q. What is the basis of sexism/racism?  
Or rather, do you believe that there is no difference between races and sexes, or do you acknowledge that there might be, but that difference doesn't stand for anything when it comes to equality.

For those who argue for equality based on actual equality  
Those who believe that What is the basis of sexism/racism? there is no difference between races or sexes; that a person's sex is not indicative of their abilities --

1.  If there were a difference, would it be okay to discriminate?  
    High IQ low IQ groups with obvious difference. Would it be okay to discriminate?
    
2.  Actual equality. Differences that exist are purely environmental. Better hope so, then we could end racism sexism. But if differences are genetic, is that enough justification to discriminate?
    

""instead we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence,  
moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact.  
Equality is a moral idea, not an assertion of fact. There is no logically compelling reason for assuming that a factual difference in ability between two people justifies any difference in the amount of consideration we give to their needs and interests. The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of an alleged actual equality among humans: it is a prescription of how we should treat human beings.""

Important: valuation of racism and and sexism based on actual equality.

the basic element is taking into account of the interests of the being whatever those interest may be

Look up Thomas Jefferson Jeremy Bentham and Henry sidgwick

Sojourner Truth:  
That’sit.What’sthatgottodowithwomen’srightsorNegroes’rights?Ifmycupwon’tholdbutapintandyoursholdsaquart,wouldn’tyou be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?

One cannot consider intellect a justifiable enough reason to justify slavery racism sexism or speciesism

Bentham:  
they come in the rest of the animal creation me a quiet those rights which never could have been with holden from them but by the hand of tyranny the friends of already discovered the blackness of the skin is no reason why human being should be abandoned without dress to the place of a tormentor it may one day come to be recognised that the number of legs the velocity of skin the determination of the sacrum are reasons equally and sufficient for abandoning is sensitive being to the same fate what else is it that should raise the insuperable line is if the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of the scores  
The question is not can they reason, or can they talk, but, can they suffer?

The capacity for suffering and enjoyment is a prerequisite for having interests at all. Elaborate.  
IMPORTANT

Difference between the demand for rights and the demand for equality. Demand for equality does not depend on the ultimate nature of rights

Rights  
In order for a being to have rights,

1.  Autonomous
2.  Member of a community
3.  Must have the ability to respect the rights of others
4.  Possess a sense of justice

The scientific definition of sentience

Why is suffering the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others why not skin colour?

is it ok to sacrifice the most important interests of members of other species in order to promote the most trivial interests of our own species my

Do non human animals have interests at all my  
This is perhaps the only justifiable defence to treat animals badly. However it has been proved today that animals are not in fact unconscious automata possessing night thoughts no feelings not a mental life of any kind

humans have a more developed cerebral cortex than other animals and this part of the brain is concerned with thinking. impulses emotions and feelings are usually located in the diencephalon, which is well developed in many animals, especially birds and mammals

Do animals feel pain? Neurological standpoint. Do they feel less pain, or feel it differently?

Pain: physical, mental. What about mental pain and to what extent?

The options of language cast doubt on the existence of the capacity to suffer wrong1

The capacity for consciousness and the capacity for language are linked. Language perhaps for abstract thought, but certainly not for primitive emotions such as joy and pain. Myth. Debunk this.

There must be evidence to believe that a being is enduring pain. Explicit language. But that ignores non-linguistic modes of communication. Wrong.

Language argument 3: human infants

Human infants argument one more: capacity for complex emotion a basis for animal experiments and testing, then use babies too.

Do complex emotions, anticipation, etc definitively imply greater suffering? Limited understanding can lead to more confusing and pain.

Can a comparison of suffering be made at all, given these additional complex emotions and capacity for thought?

Are all lives of equal worth?  
Killing Vs suffering, why make the distinction at all?

Is it okay to kill an animal painlessly?  
Choice between animal and human life always speciesist?

Animal liberation  
Against

Western attitudes towards animals derive from Judaism and Greek antiquity

Change in attitudes towards women begins from a change made in childhood. Why not a similar change for animals?

Inconsistency - one who hunts criticises those that eat meat. It is okay to do so. Breaking legs is wrong even if stated by a person that breaks arms.

Plants feel pain  
Secret life of plants - discredited

Non-human animals feel pain: evidence

1.  Behaviour
2.  nature of nervous system
3.  Evolutionary usefulness of pain

Plants do feel pain. Then definitely don't eat animals  
If at ALL POSSIBLE
