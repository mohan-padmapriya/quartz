*"Apparently, his obsessive rational thinking at that age was only compensation for all the anxieties. Because there was the father, this dominant father casting a shadow over him, judgmental, with strict moral codes, and he..." Meaning me.*
  
*Uh, "Tried so hard to please this father, to live up to his standards, but he always felt like he'd failed, so that, gradually, he developed this permanent feeling of 'I'm not good enough, I'm not moral enough, I'm too egocentric,' which, in the world he grew up in, is the worst possible sin. And on the other hand, there was the mother, who was always too weak to face down this tough father.*

*But she was such an anxious person herself that even with her, this boy, he couldn't really be himself, he couldn't share his hardships, his fears, because she'd immediately get so overwhelmed that her anxiety would only compound his.*

*And then, when he realized no one actually saw him, his true self that is, no one could help him cope with everything he was going through, he fell deeper and deeper into himself, and kept all of his pain and anxiety inside, and never told anyone anything, and this split inside him wouldn't let him truly be in a relationship, because there was always part of him that he kept hidden, he was never fully present, until Mira showed up. And to a certain extent, she saved him by seeing him. For the first time in his life, he felt like he might be pulled out of the inherent loneliness. But only after she left did he realize how, even with her, he was there-not-there, and how hard it must have been to live with this, with someone who was always partly somewhere else, inside his own head, how that could make her feel lonely and unseen. And this realization helped him deal with her leaving him, to make sense of it, and that disabused him of the idea that he'd been a victim of some kind of sudden cataclysm."*


There is so much trauma in this world... It's soul crusing. And forget the world. There is so much pain within me, that I keep hidden, from my own self. It shows up ways that are ugly, incomprehensible, and disruptive. It shows up in the way I want to be lost in my dreams. How I want to sleep all the time. How I want to run from everything, and how I do  keep running. How I reach for information, obsessively. How I consume passively. How hard I am trying to switch off, while wanting equally badly to switch on, get off autopilot...

When I am this imperfect, nay, this broken and full of chaos I son't understand myself, how do I take responsibility of someone else's feelings, how do I commit to helping someone else manouver their chaos? How do I trust another to be a pillar for me when they're crumbling wihtin themsleves from wounds of the past? 

And this entire stay single, do not expect anything, just give adn give and give more love. To different people, to all people. Never get into a relationship that binds you. There's already so many people to love, why look to specifically fall in love with just one? Is all od this some weird, convoluted defense mechanism? 
Because it makes sense, it makes perfect sense. 

But where it comes from is not a place of contentment or peace. It comes from a palce of fear and hurt. Becuase deep deep inside, and I don't kno for sure, but I'm speculating that all I want is to surrender and feel loved and wanted. By another person. But I know I will suspicious and insecure of the authenticity of that adration if it ever happens. And I might eventuallystart to feel stuck, just like Rahul did. And 'd want to run away again. Butthat would hurt my partner. And if they wanted to escape themsellves, it would hurt me...

It seems never-ending and doomed, it really does. 

And all these successful couples. they seem to built on supression and settling, which seems unhealthy again. Forget passion and intense love, that I believe is bullshit. Just growth.

Growth... How is it possible to stay in pace with another human being for years adn decades without having to slow  down at times yourself? Perhaps that's what builds resentment? The amount you compromise and sacrifice in  your growth... How much you are capable as a person. The potential, the sel factualisation... 

It is all very confusing.
