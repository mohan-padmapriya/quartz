### Day 1

> 1. *Also Technology has many dimensions like technology generation, technology acceptance, technology use, technology diffusion and maturity, technology changes and transformations etc. We see only technologies. We need to see other aspects, their interconnections and impacts.*

--> The complexity, absorbtion, and impact of technology depends heavily of the behaviour of people. 

### Day 2
> 2. *Let us compare technology and engineering. This is similar to agriculture that produces raw materials and food technology that uses raw materials and produce food. Engineering selects a number of relevent technologies ,combines them ,integrates them with connectors ,controllers ,communication units and computers so that a usable, rugged, scalable,maintainable,efficient,fault tolerant ,reliable and cost effective system is ready for use. Stand alone technology can't be put to use in complex cases of use. Such engineering is also multidimensional with architecture,design,analysis,synthesis, optimization ,failure diagnostics,operational strategies and mechanisms. It adds several degrees of complexities. Some technologies like system on chip need engineering actions. There are a large number of parameters and ecological, sociological, economic and behavioral considerations needed in engineering activities. Scope for research is enormous.*

--> Difference between technology and engineering is vital. A good engineer must be well versed with several kinds of technology in order to solve the problem at hand. Technical expertise shouldn't be a limiting factor. Do not be hesitant to step out of your comfort zone of hallf-baked CS/ECE. 

### Day 3
> 3. *Technology is agnostic of engineering disciplines. *

--> That being said, we stick religiously to our discipline (of say ECE), and try to solve the problem with that limited toolbox and biased perspective. 

> 4. When we see technology and engineering are interdisciplinary, it becomes necessary to break this barrier. Interdisciplinary, holistic approaches to teaching ,research is needed. Particularly when all engineering technologies and systems have become cyber physical systems.

--> What's the best way to pursue an interdisciplinary approach as a student?

### Day 4
> 5. *Let us have a quick look at education. Initially ,when education at a higher level started , every aspect of learning came under philosophy. May be the influence of religion. While Indian education system of early days integrated all aspects like mathematics, logic, reasoning,geometry, metallurgy, heat, biology and ecology and cosmic science into practice. Both diversity and integration were quite strong. The bias was both for spiritual and practical usage.It was Pythogorus who divided the gamut of knowledge into sciences and humanities. While west looked at language as part of humanities ,india ,   particularly , Panini looked at it from mathematical and correctness perspectives. He built a grammar called Ashtadhyayi to provide precise rules and procedures.  Later the formalisation of education in the west led to the establishment of universities dealing with all areas. That is why they are called universities. Later segmentation started. We got institutes of technology, universities of science/medicine etc. We set up departments. **They became islands.** The need of the hour is to break the barriers. It is not done by regulatory actions, but through thought leadership, mindset changes and cross fertilisation amongst disciplines . Interdisciplinary activities exist but they consider themselves different. They don't help in integration and diversification. *

--> Clearly, the institute-university system is now outdated. What a strange, new kind of outdated. That's the next thing, after Sugata Mitra's get over current system that prepares people for clerical, assemby line jobs. Interdisciplinary stuff is next. What systems will solidify the foundations for such an approach? 
--> What would a completely interdisciplinary institurion look like? 
--> Would it be easier and more practical then to allow a problem or a field of problems to direct courses a student in such an interdisciplinary srudent takes? Or am I just obsessed?

### Day 5
> 6. *We need to look at core components -**materials,energy, sensors and measurements, control and automation, basics of design, analysis , problem solving techniques, basic engineering principles and manufacturing principles, visualization, problem generation and exploration ,social behaviour science,technology diffusion, social ecological and life style impacts of technology, smart networks of water,gas,power and transportation, systems science and engineering, engineering practices ,integration methodologies, cyber physical systems , technology trends and futures, engineering philosophy etc before we talk of disciplines**. *

### Day 6
> 7. *Now Let us look at the impact of technology on our nature and resources. Engineering impacts our living*

Sustainable, antifragile systems are necessary. What are characteristics of such systems?

### Day 7
> 8. *One example was ASTRA ole with efficiencies of 30%. The study of choolas was mocked at by several faculty in engineering colleges . Similarly when we started studying rural technologies and biogas plants and solar energy devices, we got a lot of backlash and mockery from a very large number of faculty including from IITs and IISc. Some suggested it will take us backwards in development. Fortunately people accepted it  but still did not work on it or include it in teaching. Only renewable energy like solar and wind energies got an acceptable status now.  When Karnataka Government proposed Bedthi Hydro electric project, I did a calculation to show that energy balance is better with run of the river plant and not a storage reservoir.  So no big dams were needed. Cost came down. Ecology got preserved. But it was not accepted.*

Look for less obvious alternatives

### Day 8
> 9. *Engineers perform certain tasks like building dams, paper and sugar factories etc. The government wants a detailed project report  DPR before approval of a project. I have read a number of them. They glorify the benefits . But in reality something else happens. Engineers construct dams. They should be aware of the use of water. There was a holistic view and serious concern for society by Sir Visvesvaraya when he built the krishna raja dam on Cauvery. He took care of the canals and asked a promise from Mandya farmers not to cut trees in their fields and not to shift to sugar cane. His concern for overall use is clear. Similarly he took a holistic view for the construction of Bhadravathy Iron and steel plant in 1937. He didn't want coking coal to be transported over 2500 plus kilometers. He experimented with charcoal . It is the first time in the history. His concern for environment made him to give 10000 ha to the factory for sustained production of charcoal. He also brought iron ore through overhead trolleys thereby avoiding destruction of forest area by movement of trucks and saving diesel. When the Thippagondanahalli water reservoir supplying water to Bangalore City was breached in 1937, engineers wanted to empty the reservoir. He said it is criminal to empty the reservoir . He deviced ways of repairing the breach without emptying water. It was another innovation.*

### Day 9
> 10. *Take the case of a rayon factory in Harihar. It was happily letting of effluents into Tunga Bhadra river. This led to health problems for people. But they continued for a long time.The effluents could have been treated to retrieve energy. Another paper mills was polluting water sources in Mandya by letting black liquor into a stream. Water became undrinkable. So people suffered. There is no politics here. I can quote a lot of instances because I was handling environment in the government. A simple solvable problem will open our eyes. The water supply to nanjangudu town has a take off - inlet -after the industries  upstream polluting the river. So people got polluted water. A simple change of take off being shifted upstream would have solved the problem at least immediately. Because pollution control is still after 40 years a mere show.*

How to make pollution control profitable, sustainable? Apart from regulations.
