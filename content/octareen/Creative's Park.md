- How do we make [[Remote collaboration]] better?
- What can we do to up interaction?



# Problem statements
- Knowledge or information management
- Reliable assessment of cognitive function
	- Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Cognitive impairment is a sometimes neglected, yet common, sign and symptom with a profound effect on instrumental activities of daily living. Even before diagnosis, patients may experience cognitive dysfunction that manifests through symptoms such as memory lapses or difficulty with finding the right words in conversation. The Seeker desires a tool for assessing cognitive function and tracking performance over time.
	- Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath, a protective coating that surrounds nerve cells. Without the insulation of myelin, electrical impulses cannot be transmitted quickly or efficiently leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, loss of balance and coordination, vision loss, and fatigue. In addition to these physical impairments, patients may also experience a decline in cognitive function. The most common test for cognitive screening in MS is the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), but it is not routinely used in clinical practice as it requires trained personnel for administration and can be time consuming. Therefore, the Seeker is interested in new approaches to assess cognitive function that can be used on a periodic basis without the help of a licensed professional and ideally done reliably from home.

- Fast intelligence from flowing news - [[Innocentive]]
	- Staying informed about events that impact markets and business is critical to success in any field. With the ever-increasing flow of news and information over multiple channels and forms of media, keeping up-to-date and informed about the latest events is both easier and more difficult. Easier because news can be obtained anywhere at any time, but more difficult due to the need to sort and sift through the vast amount of incoming information in order to extract and contextualize valuable intelligence. The Seeker is interested in exploring new tools, techniques, or methods to reduce the effort required to process the news and aid in turning the flowing news into insightful intelligence about events that impact their business. Proposed solutions should focus on both automated extraction and effective visualization of insightful events from news flows and be presented in the form of an implemented algorithm.
	- The Generation and Trading Business Unit of A2A, the Seeker for this Challenge, trades energy commodities such as fuels, electricity, and environmental certificates on domestic and international markets. Commodity prices are volatile and market expectations about demand and supply can influence their upward and downward movements. Understanding what is happening in the world is essential for promptly reacting to price changes to avoid losses and/or earn profits. Unfortunately, continuously monitoring what is happening worldwide is time consuming and commodity traders are often busy in trading desk operations. The Seeker is interested in exploring tools, techniques, or methods that can support their trading activities by turning the flowing news into insightful events and accelerating context comprehension and decision-making. Solvers are asked to develop and implement an algorithm that ingests news titles, identifies relevant events, collects additional information about those events, and then effectively presents the collected insights using easy to understand visualizations.
	- USV [[Innocentive]]
		- The US Navy has a requirement for an expeditionary security Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that is modular and attritable (low-cost and unmanned that can be reused at least several times with minimal maintenance.) Given the expeditionary nature of the system, it must be produced or assembled at the point of need to provide the flexibility required to meet evolving mission needs. This Challenge seeks novel designs for a USV that can be shipped in a standard 20 foot shipping container, produced or assembled on site in less than two hours, and capable of carrying or towing a variety of payloads.
	-  Water toxicity sensor - [[Innocentive]]
		-  This Challenge is requesting new design solutions for biologically based sensors for use in water systems that can detect the activation of one or more human toxicity pathways. Toxicity pathways are the perturbations to normal biological processes that occur due to exposure to a stressor, such as a chemical, that has the potential to lead to adverse health effects. Although the sensor might not identify a specific contaminant/toxin, it should be able to measure or quantitate the level of activation of one or more toxicity pathways when the sensor is exposed to water that contains relevant amounts of contaminants/toxins targeting the pathway(s).

----------------------------------------------------------

• Direction given by the recommender og the book  
• Julian Swinger - Persona outwards and inward  
• Bring out deeper aspects  
• Separating person from the work --> mathematical and mechanical. Take only creative aspects, passion, invlvement --> excerising discretion  
• Moralists and virtue signalling is wrong --> vivekam but not overcaution

 # Meeting 1
 ## Discussion
 ### Book Club
 - **Logistics**
	 - Book selected and posted on the 4th Sunday of every month
	 - Live discussion (attendance not mandatory) scheduled for the 4th Sunday of every month: 12 noon to 1 PM IST
 - **Discussion**
	 - Begin asynchronous discussion in the comments of the post
	 - Mention prompts and anchoring points in the post, that will guide you as you read
		 - The recommender of the book of the month can give direction.
			 - This will allow bringing out the deeper aspects while avoiding over-caution or moralising
 ### AcWriMo 
 - **Logistics:**
	 - Announce *Academic Writing Month* with emphasis on developing a writing habit as well as gaining exposure via Blog Journals
	 - Specify method to submit articles written for the month
 - **Discussion**
	 - Blog Journals will be open to the public but we will not unnecessarily publicise the articles
	 - Charu's account to be made
### Asking better questions (*needs a better name*)
 - **Logistics**
	 - Select a theme/topic and encourage everyone to ask questions about it
	 - Can be done asynchronously, on the platform, rather than scheduling a meeting for it
 - **Discussion**
	 - Aim to increase involvement and interaction in the blog journals
	 - Use *Curiosity* to make these posts?
### CFRCE's digital library
 - **Logistics**
	 - Use Google Drive to publish a curated library
		 - Descriptions for each book
	 - View-only for students, secured by google authenticator
	 - Integrate with the platform
	 - EBK is private, have folders for each student in it
