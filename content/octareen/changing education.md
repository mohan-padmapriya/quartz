The question you're trying to answer:
```
1. CFRCE like place, rather we just come to school to socialise and develop in that way, learn at home as an accepted thing, using the internet
2. what if school was a video game
3. School for how to use internet rather than absolute stuff
```

## Title questions
1. Has the internet really changed learning?
2. J Lanier - Is internet collectivism horrible horrible? AI is collectivism, is it not? How different, what to keep in mind and be warned about?
# Learning Today

** To keep in mind:**
- Don’t ever copy the source word for word.
- This is the dialog you are having with the writer of your sources. This is your attempt to say back to the author “this is what I understand you are saying.
- Read a paragraph, say it loud to yourself
- Take about two to three times as many notes, by word, as you will need for your essay. 

>Reading 1. **Prof Ravindra Kumar **
**Notes: **
What characterises the students of today?
A. The internet
> + Knowledge has become accessible to us in modules, rather than in vast and continuous -- of literature. We might access several of these modules of knowledge, pertaining to the same domain of intrest, simultaneously. (More than one reference)
> + Learning is non-linear, rather than linear; Unconventional jumps are possible, things are certainly multi and interdisciplinary now. *elaborate, is this is what is meant by non-linearity*
> + Learning is **_self-paced_** and **_self organised_**. Learner is not passive, like in a classroom, dependant on the teacher. They are in control of knowledge gathering, of knowledge sifting, and of how all this information gets used
> + Learning has dematerialised, digital (Look up the Ds from [[Bold]]) 
> + Role of academic journals behind paywalls, the university structure itself
> + Community rather than classroom. *How big is this community, implications*
> + The internet has deinstitutionalised knowledge ([[Bold]]).
> + Boundaries and categories of knowledge have faded. *Is there a better structure*
> + Knowledge is not a static object meant to be pursued, it is dynamic, alive, characterised by networks and flow, meant to be interacted with
> + There are no universal truths, absolutes. There are several realities
> + Gone from teacher centered delivery to student centered absorbtion and organisation
> + More about patterns and sequences, rather than straight lines of approach and comprehension
> + Therefore, while thinking about something or teaching, it is important to focus both on _constitution_ and _interpretation_




Reading 2. Delor's report at UNESCO

Notes:

> Reading 3. Prof Mitra
> Notes:
> ***IMPORTANT: Gap between the elite and the common people, how internet changed that, what role education played in it***
> Primary education has changed from being focused on reciting and listening to writing (spelling and handwriting) and reading comprehension
> ==Changing technology changes education== Technologies of then - sewing machines, knitting, kitchen automation. Log tables, rulers, protractors compasses. Coding today. *Partivularly, it changes teaching strategies*
> Oral tradition - focus on memorisation. Now written - focus on good notes *Have we forgotten how to have conversations with teachers about material*
> ==Communication was through a chain of command, invented earlier in the military==
> Reading, writing, arithmetic --> obsolete?
> *Leave our industrial education pasts and proceed towards what kind of future?*
> Elite - liberal arts; workmen - engineers. Same ish diviiision today. *So is the way our society is divided a consequence of how systems of education are categorised*
> One teacher many kids model of the oral tradition is useless
> ![](OMG.png)
> How does the change in mechanistic to probablistic an dchaotic physics and in the same extension worldview reflect in education?
> ![](result-sole.png)
> In rural areas, lack of competency in teachers makes a huge difference. Therefore perhaps this could help.

Reading 4. DKS messages

Notes: 

> Reading 5. **[Neil Selwyn, Monash University - Education in the age of the internet](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-internet-and-education/)**
> Notes: 
> 1. Although it is difficult and even foolish to talk about contemporary education without taking the internet into consideration, we must note that a majority of the world does not have internet access. Moreover, even development of mobile communications and network access does not guarentee a change in this situation; we might see the gap become larger as the already privileged benefit more from this development. *inequality of access might drastically increase*
> 2. How does the educational potential of the Internet relate to the realities of its use?
> 3. At its core, the way the internet works is similar to what an important aspect of education is all about - information
> 4. ==The participatory, communal nature of many social Internet applications and activities is aligned closely with the fundamental qualities of how humans learn, not least the practices of creating, sharing, collaborating, and critiquing==
> 5. “a radically democratic zone of infinite connectivity” (Murphy 2012, 122)
> Implications:
	> 1. Individual learners are no longer bound by the constraints of physical space (how important is physical space)
	> 2. around _bottom-up_ principles of collective exploration, play, and innovation rather than _top-down_ individualized instruction (Thomas and Seely-Brown 2011). Similar to Prof RK on learner centered rather than teacher centered. *many to many rather than one to many* --> implications?
	> 3. fluid intelligence and collectivism --> nature of information and knowledge due tp the interaction is very different from what it was
	> 4. (Chatti, Jarke, and Quix 2010).
	> 5. Personalised learning
> Culture of learning: conventional vs internet
	> lack of expertise: anything but that, since learners now have access to experts worldwide, unlimited by their immediate physical environment *socio-constructivist mode of cognition*. *many to many rather than one to many* (Luckin 2010)
>  Tradtional forms of schooling, monopoly of one system, profesionals challenged
>  _school 2.0_ is focused on social interaction, exploration, gaming, making
>  *no school*: DIY education; however this calls for so much more self-determination, self-organization, self-regulation. *Can educational institutions really be done away with?*
>  ==Jeff Jarvis (2009, 210) concluded in an acclaimed overview of the Internet’s societal significance, “education is one of the institutions most deserving of disruption—and with the greatest opportunities to come of it.==
	>  alright, internet is disrupting the schooling system, how could we make the best of it, best of both worlds?
>  ==Today a student who makes the slightest correction to a Wikipedia article is contributing more to the state of public knowledge, in a matter of minutes, than I was able to do over the course of my entire grade school education, such as it was.== John Willinsky
>  veryday use of the Internet can be seen as an inherently educational activity. *elaborate*
>  What's not really revolutionary:
>  1. ***ALthough internet is changing education, the education we access via the internet is shaped mainly by expert teachers, grades, assignments, distinct subject areas, classrooms*** Old wine in new bottle?
>  2. Mathew effect - main _impact_ is that of increasing rather than widening educational participation.
>  ==In this respect, perhaps the most significant issues that need to be considered about the Internet and education are sociological, rather than technical, in nature.==
> To think about:
	> How useful is the individualisation, really?
		> ==As such this individualization of action leads to education becoming an area of increased risk as well as opportunity.==
		> Is it really equal? Huge gap between driven vs driving seat students no? Huge sense of responsibility, etc
		> ==These issues raise a number of important questions. For instance, just how equal are individuals in being able to make the educational _choices_ that the Internet actually offers? How are the apparent educational freedoms of the Internet resulting in enhanced _unfreedoms_ (such as the intensification and extension of educational _work_ into domestic settings)? To what extent are _personalized_ forms of Internet education simply facilitating the _mass customization_ of homogenous educational services and content? What is the nature of the collective forms of Internet-based education? How do _communities_ of learners established through the Internet differ in terms of social diversity, obligation, or solidarity? Is the Internet undermining or even eroding notions of education as a public good?==
		> Data driven learning gen, what implications
		> _always-on_ state of potential educational engagement. Indeed, the _anytime, anyplace_ nature of online education clearly involves the expansion of education and learning into domestic, work, and community settings where education and learning might previously have not been prominent.
		> learning as a competitive endeavour
		> virtual

>Reading 6.  **[Individual Knowledge in the Internet Age - Larry Sanger](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/4/individual-knowledge-in-the-internet-age)**
>Notes: 
>***Internet is a ready mental prosthesis***
>1. Is memorisaton the way it is happening in schools today unnecessary given the internet? (content)
	> ==Surely the only way to know something is to have memorized it. How can I be said to know something that I do _not_ remember?==
	> Educationists are not opposed to memorisation per say, but memorisation by rote, without having understood the concept or without experience. Mere repetition.
	> Is the internet now an extension of our personal knowledge/memory? 
	> David Dalrymple - If the internet now acts as an extension of our memory, one is knowledgable not based on the body of knowledge he has accumulated over the years, but based on how he is able access the internet, think critically, and most of all, be *focused*. ==Knowledge was once an internal property of a person, and focus on the task at hand could be imposed externally, but with the Internet, knowledge can be supplied externally, but focus must be forced internally==
	> Hence, it might be unnecessary to *know* stuff that is googlable; googleable stuff must not be considered while concluding whether a person is knowledgable or not
	> ==But to claim that the Internet allows us to learn less, or that it makes memorizing less important, is to belie any profound grasp of the nature of knowledge.== *How?*
	> Looking up something is not equivalent to completely understanding it either. It's just as bad as rote memorisation. To truly know or understand something requires critical study. Interpretation of what you have looked up comes only when you have adequate background. *content and interpretation point by prof RK* (But this can be got with the help of the internet as a mental prosthesis no?)
	> Most importantly, this context is important to ask the right questions.* How is asking the right questions affected by this look up on google substitution?*
	> ==he point is to develop judgment or understanding of questions that require a nuanced _grasp_ of the various facts and to thereby develop the ability to think about and use those facts. If you do not have copious essential facts at the ready, then you will not be able to make wise judgments that depend on your understanding of those facts, regardless of how fast you can look them up.==
	> Agreed, learning how to learn is most important. But to say that because of the ever changing nature of science, tech, and society, that learning facts with a short lifespan is saying old information can be replaced by new information. ==new information can trivialise old information== 
	> Therefore, the accumulated knowledge base (of bio, of math, of engineering) is relevant
	> *But are basics = facts that can be rote memorised = facts that can be looked up? Don't think so, so perhaps in a lot of ways, this argument is irrelevant*
> 2. Celebration of the virtues of collaborative learning as superior to outmoded individual learning (Method)
	> If a student doesn't participate in class, what makes you think he will participate online? 
	> ==But there is no reason to think that adopting the tool — online conversation — will necessarily reproduce, in students, either the motivation to pursue interests or the resulting increase in knowledge.==
	> Significant level of useful feedback for your work online is not guarenteed
	> ==So it goes, I suspect, with all social media. There is no reason to think that repurposing social media for education will magically make students more inspired and engaged. What inspires and engages some people about social media is the passion for their individual, personal interests, as well as the desire to stay in touch with friends. Remove those crucial elements, and you merely have some neat new software tools that make communication faster.==
	> On cartesian and social learning. Look up Brown, Adler. Is social learning really superior to cartesian learning, given that all the major work has to be put in independantly by the student themselves. You might be inspired, motivated, fascinated by others and discussions and the social learning setup, but it cannot substitute your own foundational effort and participattion. 
	> ==These four activities — reading, writing, critical thinking, and calculation — should make up the vast bulk of a liberal education. Social learning could not replace these individual, "Cartesian" activities without jettisoning liberal education itself.==
> Are books outdated
	> *Note that written literature has become our primary and predominant method of information and idea transmission only now. Ancient india, ideas orally? What was the role of memorisation then?*
	> Biggest complaint - Books are not interactive, not collaborative
	> ==Perhaps the notion is that knowledge-as-co-created by students is superior to knowledge-as-passed-along-by-teachers-and-books, regardless of quality. Perhaps the accuracy of the information co-created by students does not matter, because as shared information it enjoys a social validity that dusty old volumes and teachers speaking from authority cannot. Perhaps the subtlety and depth of thinking that comes from critical reading and evaluation of great writers does not matter, because information is now ultimately best understood as belonging to and produced by large groups of people.==
	> Long, and dense, and difficult, and complex books are important (*why?*)
	> ***Read references***




Reading 7. Andrew Keen's _The Cult of the Amateur_

Notes: 

Reading 8. Mark Bauerlein's _The Dumbest Generation_,

Notes: 

 Reading 9. [Aaron Lanier's essay "Digital Maoism.](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism)
> Notes:
> *Online collectivism* - inherently not a good idea. =="the Wikipedia is far from being the only online fetish site for foolish collectivism. There's a frantic race taking place online to become the most "Meta" site, to be the highest level aggregator, subsuming the identity of all other sites".==
> Online collectivism is different from representative democracy or meriticracy. Elaborate.
> ==A core belief of the wiki world is that whatever problems exist in the wiki will be incrementally corrected as the process unfolds.==
> ==anonymous, faux-authoritative, anti-contextual brew of the Wikipedia.==. How important is this lack of editorial voice to the success of wikipedia?
> Reddit vs wiki; or stackex vs wiki.  Why is the distinction important?
> ==We now are reading what a collectivity algorithm derives from what other collectivity algorithms derived from what collectives chose from what a population of mostly amateur writers wrote anonymously.
==
> How narratives form
> ==The aggregator is richer than the aggregated.==
> ==bad old ideas look confusingly fresh when they are packaged as technology.==
> ==You get to include all sorts of material without committing to anything. You can be superficially interesting without having to worry about the possibility of being wrong.==. Simply an aggregator. But where would such aggregators be profoundly useful? Markets are one example, where the collective is key to the functioning. But so are individual expert voices. There is a good balance.
> Wiki vs open source software?
> ==The collective is good at solving problems which demand results that can be evaluated by uncontroversial performance parameters, but bad when taste and judgment matter.==
> The collective is more likely to be smart when it isn't defining its own questions, when the goodness of an answer can be evaluated by a simple result (such as a single numeric value,) and when the information system which informs the collective is filtered by a quality control mechanism that relies on individuals to a high degree. Under those circumstances, a collective can be smarter than a person. --> AI
> Opinions are not slow, the collective edits all the time. No checks and alances of time in place, like with elections, etc
> ==All intelligence is collective. But, as Lanier points out, that does not mean that all collectives are intelligent.==
> ==I think the real argument is between voting or aggregating — where anonymous people raise or lower things in esteem by the weight of sheer numbers — vs. arguments by recognizable, individuals that answer the arguments of other individuals...==
