# [[Wealth]] is assets that earn while you sleep
# [[Wealth]] buys you freedom
- To do things that are higher quality, more creative
# [[Money is evil | Money]] is how we transfer [[Wealth]]
- It is a neutral indicator of value
- It is the ability to have debits and credits of other people's time
# Status is your rank in the social hierarchy
> *There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Money is not going to solve _all_ of your problems; but it’s going to solve all of your _money_ problems. I think people know that. They realize that, so they want to make money. At the same time, deep down many people believe they can’t make it; so they don’t want any wealth creation to happen. They virtue signal by attacking the whole enterprise, saying, “Well, making money is evil. You shouldn’t do it.”*

- Status is a nasty, [[zero sum game]] where you have to topple the ones on top to get there.

# Status is a very old game
- It is super tribal and instincts-oriented
- Goes back all the way, and has a huge history in evolution
- But we're beyond that now
- Status is however, a better predictor than wealth when it comes to survival



# People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games
> *Status games are always going to exist; there’s no way around it. Realize that most of the time when you’re trying to create wealth, you’re getting attacked by someone else and they’re trying to look like a goody-two shoes. They’re trying to up their own status at your expense.*


# Ethical [[Wealth]] creation makes abundance for the world
> - *Obviously, there isn’t a finite number of jobs, or finite amount of wealth.*
> - *Most of the wealth in civilization, in fact all of it, has been created. It got created from somewhere. It got created from people. It got created from technology. It got created from productivity. It got created from hard work. This idea that it’s stolen is this horrible zero-sum game that people who are trying to gain status play.*


# Everyone can be rich
 - The fact that our lifestyles have been constantly upgrading, in the long run certainly, is testament to this
 - *The engine of technology is science that is applied for the purpose of creating abundance*


# Free markets are intrinsic to humans
- [[Capitalism]] is inherent in the way we interact, in the way we exchange information and more generally, value. 
- We keep track of debits and credits and that helps us make decisions that help in our survival.
> _We use credits and debits to cooperate across genetic boundaries_
> *We are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals don’t even cooperate. But when they do, they cooperate only in packs where they co-evolve together, and they share blood, so they have some shared interests.
> Humans don’t have that. I can cooperate with you guys. One of you is a Serbian. The other one is a Persian by origin. And I’m Indian by origin. We have very little blood in common, basically none. But we still cooperate.
> What lets us cooperate? It’s because we can keep track of debits and credits. Who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That’s all free market capitalism is.*

# Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin
- Not just individuals who think [[Money is evil]], there's groups of people across politics, economics, religions that believe so too
- [[Communism]]?


#todo 
> - Is wealth really a [[positive sum game]]?
> - Apart from money, what other reliable IOUs do we use to transfer wealth? How is [[Blockchain]] and [[Cryptocurrency]] changing things? is it really changing things?
> - Is status still a better predictor of survival than wealth today? How is this connected to [[Relevance]]? Is it better to play the status game? How do you play the status game? How should you remain immunised from the status game if you're playing the wealth game?
> - How relevant is the status game today, given [[Twitter]] and social media and the [[Wisdom of the Mob]]?
> - True or false? - *[[Capitalism]] is to the wealth game what [[Communism]] is to the status game*
	> - Are communists playing the status game? 
	> - Does communism assume that wealth is a zero sum game?
> - If everyone did have the skill, practically, would it possible for everyone to be rich?
> - [[Communism]] leads to success and mad wealth creation sometimes, yeah? FInd examples, and justify.lllll
