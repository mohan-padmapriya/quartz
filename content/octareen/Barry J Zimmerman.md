- Gardner, former Sec of Health Edu, welfare ==the ultimate goal of the education system is to shift to the individual the burden of pursuing his own education==
- shift of focus while understanding self regulated learning - from students' learning ability and a fixed classroom to their personally initiated responses designed to improve their ability and their environments for learning.
- self regulated learners --> self oriented feedback loop
- prerequisite to self regulation - outcome of effort must be sufficiently attractive
- ![](SRL-motivation.png)
- student's learning and motivation are interdependent
- self-initiation is a big deal: self regulated learning is more than just execution of a learning task independantly or adjusting learning responses based in negative feedback
- ![](SRL-def.png)
- Typical SRL strategies: 
		- ***self-evaluation*** - techniques? Apparently not as popular (Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1986)
		- organisation and transformation
		- goal setting and planning 
		- information seeking
		- record keeping
		- self-monitoring
		- environmental structuring
		- setting self consequences
		- rehearsing and memorising
		- seeking social assistance
		- reviewing
		
- students who are not SRL - lack of strategies, rather than lack of motivation
- strategy use involves more than mere knowledge of the strategy (Schneider, 1985)
- Monitoring learning outcomes is a complex metacognitive activity that involves directed attention and sophisticated reasoning processes

- ![](SRL-outcomes.png)

- Awareness of the self as agent
- self efficacy rating as a source of motivation
- problems in self regulation typically arise when there are discrepencies in long term and short term outcomes (want to play but have school work. Delayed gratification is difficult to learn, but perhaps reduce the discrepency between the outcomes (so even working seems like playing - gamification)) (Thoressen and Mahoney, 1974)
- relationship between goal setting and perceptions of self-efficacy are inversely related (Schunk)
- ***Self regualation in young children  and SOLE***
- Misconception: e.g., younger students are inferior to older students in their use of
metacognitive skills and therefore need more guidance and external regulation than
1/do older students

Rogers, 2004: focus from disbursing scarce knowledge to navigating unlimited information

- one of the key issues in self-regulated learning is the students' ability to select, combine, and coordinate cognitive strategies in an e!ective way.

### Learning and processing styles
- Marton and Saljo K (1984) - shallow vs deep processing
- Pask (1988) holistic vs serialistic
- Entwistle (1988) reproducing (memorisation), achieving (high grades), meaning(personal understanding) orientation
- Vermunt (1992) deep, surface, and concrete level with out of control, external, and internal regulation

- ![](SRL-3layers.png)
- external regulation is a form of support that replaces or compensates for low
metacognitive awareness and that students who are not skillful in orienting, planning, monitoring, or evaluating their own performance may rely instead on the teacher's metacognitive skills. (Weinert, Schrader & Helmke, 1989). 
- This unhealthy dependance transcends domain and time
- investigations have been restricted to the metacognitive control system; activity in other control systems (e.g., motivation control, action control, and emotion control) has not been well integrated into theories of SRL
- ![](SRL-whyAndWhyNot.png)
- Despite being aware of one's goals, and the investments and resources to attain that goal, one might still be reluctant to make these investments. Why? 
	- planning, execution, evaluation is too much effort and time
	- autonomy, competence, social belonging - not satisfied. 
	- informal and formal learning contexts
	- ![](SRL-intentionNotEnough.png)
	- volition control vs motivational control

#### How to create powerful learning environment
- ====To put it di!erently, having or not having access to an adaptive profile of regulatory skills shapes the learning environment and determines whether one considers that environment as instrumental to achieve the learning goals that one has set for oneself.====

#### Tips
- ![](SRL-tips.png)
- Extremely important to know which SRL strategies are being adopted by a student and how to turn learning environments into energisers
- Students should have access to -
	- cognitive learning strategies
	- metacognitive and regulation strategies
	- resource management strategies
- adaptive profile of motivational beliefs
- self regulators - positive feedback; self controllers - negative
